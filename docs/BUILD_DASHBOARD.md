# 9router-go Native Embedded Dashboard: Build and Architecture Guide

This document describes the current native Go gateway and its embedded Svelte/Vite dashboard. It is a build and operations guide, not a feature-compatibility checklist. The current release metadata is `v1.9.1`; the repository manifest tracks upstream `v0.5.85`, while the changelog separately lists `v0.5.86` parity items. Do not treat those statements as a complete upstream-parity guarantee.

## Architecture

The Go process owns the HTTP server, SQLite repository, authentication, proxy handlers, and lifecycle. The dashboard is a Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite SPA. During a build, Vite writes optimized static files to `web/dist`; `web/embed.go` embeds `dist/*` into the Go executable. At runtime the browser receives the embedded files and calls the Go HTTP API.

```

Production does not need Node.js, Bun, or Vite after the binary is built. The generated `web/dist` directory is ignored by Git and may be absent in a fresh checkout. A Go build therefore needs the frontend prerequisites and a successful frontend build first. `go build` is not a self-sufficient substitute for that prerequisite.

## Prerequisites

Install the versions used by the repository before building:

- Go **1.27** (from `go.mod` and the release workflow).
- Bun **1.4.2** (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `release.yml`).
- A writable `DATA_DIR`, or the default platform data directory (`~/.9router` on Unix-like systems, `%APPDATA%/9router` on Windows).
- Configuration for `JWT_SECRET` and `INITIAL_PASSWORD` when deploying. The application can generate a JWT secret when one is not supplied, but operators should set a strong value explicitly. Do not ship a known initial password.
- For optional release/cross-build work: the target Go toolchains and the platform-specific tools required by the selected build path. `RTK` is optional and is not required to build.

## Build the frontend

From the repository root:

```bash
cd web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run lint
bun run build
cd ..
```

`bun run build` runs the TypeScript project build and Vite production build. It must produce at least `web/dist/index.html` and the referenced assets. The current `web/package.json` does not define a `test` script; do not document `bun run test` as an available build prerequisite. Frontend test automation is tracked in `ROADMAP.md` until the manifest and CI provide a test command.

`web/dist` is generated, not source. Remove or rebuild it when diagnosing stale assets:

```bash
rm -rf web/dist
cd web && bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build
```

## Build the Go binary

The normal path is the repository Makefile. It builds `web/dist` when it is missing, then embeds it and compiles the binary with the version from `VERSION` (or the documented fallback):

```bash
make build
```

`make web-build` is a prerequisite-only target. It runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run build` only when `web/dist/index.html` is missing or `FORCE=1` is set. It is not a substitute for an explicit frontend verification.

For a direct build, complete the frontend step first and then run:

```bash
test -f web/dist/index.html
go build -ldflags="-s -w -X '9router/proxy/internal/updater.CurrentVersion=$(cat VERSION)'" -o 9router-go ./cmd/9router-go
```

RTK may wrap the Go command in a developer environment, but it is optional and must not obscure failures from `go build`.

## Run and verify

Configure a data directory and secrets, then start the binary:

```bash
export DATA_DIR="$HOME/.9router"
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" # use a persistent, protected value in deployments
export INITIAL_PASSWORD='set-a-unique-local-password'
PORT=20130 ./9router-go
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:20130` by default. Check both the gateway and the embedded dashboard:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:20130/health
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:20130/api/hello
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:20130/
```

With a fresh, valid embedded bundle, `/` and client-side dashboard routes return the SPA; missing asset paths return 404 rather than silently becoming HTML. Browser dashboard routes may redirect to `/login` when login is required. The login/session API is separate from the client API-key routes; do not infer authorization from the fact that a page loads.

Before using an existing SQLite file, verify that its schema is compatible with the current Go handlers. Startup bootstraps the core schema idempotently (`db.EnsureCoreSchema`: tables, indexes, Go-only columns, `_meta`/settings seeds) plus the `upstream_leases` table, so a fresh `DATA_DIR` no longer needs a copied upstream file. What is still missing is the upstream versioned migration runner and legacy JSON import; see `ROADMAP.md`.

## Docker build

The Dockerfile is self-contained for a normal image build: its frontend stage installs Bun dependencies and builds `web/dist`, and the Go stage downloads modules and embeds the generated assets. It still requires network access to fetch Go and Bun modules, sufficient build resources, and a valid `VERSION` argument/fallback.

```bash
VERSION="$(cat VERSION)" docker build -t 9router-go .
```

The runtime image contains the Go binary and CA/time-zone support; it does not require a JavaScript runtime. Persistent application data must be mounted outside the container image and passed with `DATA_DIR`.

## Release and CI notes

CI currently builds the frontend, runs `go vet`, runs `go test ./...`, and builds the Go binary. It does not currently run a frontend test command, race detector, coverage gate, or release-time vulnerability scan. The release workflow builds cross-platform binaries and uploads `SHA256SUMS.txt`; its metadata must still be checked against `VERSION`, `version.json`, the tag, and changelog claims before publication.

For a release candidate, reproduce the relevant checks in a clean environment, record toolchain versions and the exact frontend build, and verify the embedded dashboard with a running binary. Do not report a successful frontend build as proof that a Go build, migration, auth boundary, or release artifact succeeded.
