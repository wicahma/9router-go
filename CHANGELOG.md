# Changelog


## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Kiro OAuth auto-refresh + token selection (`e956cda` parity)

- Kiro OAuth connections now refresh proactively: `internal/proxy/oauth/background.go` runs a 5-minute tick (30-minute lead window) over active OAuth connections and persists rotated tokens; wired in `internal/app/server.go` alongside the catalog sync. The refresher registry (`oauth.RegisterAll`) already registers a Kiro refresher, so the loop refreshes every due OAuth connection, not just Kiro.
- New `internal/proxy/oauth/kiro.go` refresher routes by stored credentials: AWS SSO OIDC (`clientId`/`clientSecret` + region, camelCase contract against `https://oidc.<region>.amazonaws.com/token`) or the desktop social endpoint. `oauth.Params` gained `ProviderSpecificData` so login-time credentials reach refreshers (all call sites updated).
- `resolveProviderAuthToken` (upstream `e956cda` parity): Kiro connections with `authMethod != "api_key"` now send `accessToken`, not `apiKey` — previously the wrong credential produced `403 The bearer token included in the request is invalid`. `ForwardKiro` gained `TokenType`/`profile-arn` headers and endpoint rotation `q.<region>` → `codewhisperer.<region>` → `runtime.kiro.dev` with 401/403/404 fallback (400 stays terminal).
- Kiro's translator (`OpenAIToKiro` envelope) is not ported yet; request bodies forward verbatim — documented in `executor/providers.go`.
- Tests: `kiro_token_test.go`, `grokcli_kiro_test.go` (upstream), plus `background_test.go` selection table and a live-refresh test that skips without `/tmp/kiro_conn.json`.

### 🐛 Dashboard logging, request details, and cached-token parity

- Moved console-log APIs to the dashboard-authenticated `/api/translator/console-logs*` boundary; dashboard sessions and local CLI tokens work, while engine API keys cannot read operational logs or change global log level.
- Removed the shipped hardcoded dashboard API-key fallback and made frontend error handling unwrap nested API error messages instead of displaying `[object Object]`.
- Captured terminal usage from complete OpenAI/Claude SSE events, normalized Claude cache-inclusive prompt counts, and preserved cached read/create tokens through streaming and non-streaming translation.
- Added compatibility reads for legacy and nested cached-token JSON shapes in usage stats, request details, and recent-request hydration.
- Persisted sanitized failure/cancellation request details without duplicating successful usage records; Responses executor requests now persist actual token usage.

### 🐛 Antigravity Google OAuth redirect

- Matched the upstream Next.js Antigravity OAuth contract end-to-end: `redirect_uri=http://localhost:<dashboard-port>/callback`, the public `/callback` landing page, and `POST /api/oauth/antigravity/exchange` for the dashboard-authenticated token exchange.
- Restored Antigravity's upstream Google scopes (`cclog` and `experimentsandconfigs`) and added loopback callback relay through `postMessage`, preserving automatic handoff for local/forwarded dashboard access.
- Added authorize, redirect validation, token-exchange, frontend request, callback landing, and auth-boundary regression coverage; removed the obsolete `/api/oauth/antigravity/callback` contract.

### 🐛 Media example request headers

- Stopped masked API keys returned by `GET /api/keys` (for example, `sk-8b7…e34f`) from being copied into browser `Authorization` headers, which caused Chromium to reject requests with `String contains non ISO-8859-1 code point`.
- Media example runners now require a usable full key, store newly created keys locally for the current dashboard session, and avoid sending masked/non-ASCII credentials.

### 🐛 Antigravity search account failover

- `POST /v1/search` with an Antigravity model now rotates through all active Antigravity accounts: a `403 VALIDATION_REQUIRED` ("Verify your account") locks only that account's search model and the next account is tried, matching upstream `markAccountUnavailable`/`checkFallbackError` failover.
- Fixed the direct-client 403 retry in media requests masking the real upstream status: direct retry now only fires on transport errors, so account verification failures surface correctly instead of being hidden.

### 🐛 Media providers audit (search/fetch/image/STT/TTS)

- Failover: Xquik search, Antigravity image, Antigravity STT, and Nvidia TTS now rotate through all active accounts with per-account `ClassifyError` locks and success unlocks, matching the upstream `search.js`/`tts.js`/`imageGeneration.js` credential loops. Pinned `x-connection-id` is honored exactly once.
- Correctness: fixed the Xquik registry `BaseURL` (host + path were wrong), clamped `max_results` to upstream `5..100`, stopped forcing a default `queryType`, added `answer:null` and `response_time_ms`/`upstream_latency_ms` to the Xquik envelope, and preserved original upstream error statuses instead of collapsing to 502.
- Safety: request-scoped 4xx (400/405/409/422/…) no longer lock accounts (`ClassifyError` parity with upstream `checkFallbackError`); video creation no longer rotates on 5xx (billable-job parity with `CREATE_ROTATION_STATUSES`); multipart model rewrites are byte-exact so binary file bytes can't be corrupted.
- Isolation: a pinned connection ID must belong to the requested provider — cross-provider credential use is now rejected in `GetBestConnection`.
- TTS: Nvidia honors provider/connection base URL overrides; Edge-TTS rejects sub-1KiB error payloads as empty audio (upstream parity).
- Frontend: the image Run body now matches the curl example (`background`, `image_detail`).
## [v1.9.1] - 2026-09-25

### 🐛 Dashboard: Custom Models Parity — Combo Picker Unwraps `{models}` Envelope

- `web/src/lib/customModels.ts` (new): shared `parseCustomModelsResponse` (`{models:[...]}` upstream shape, tolerates bare-array/record-map), `parseDisabledModelsMap` (`{disabled:{...}}` upstream + bare map go-port), `notifyCustomModelsChanged` / `subscribeCustomModelsChanged` (`customModelChanged` + `focus` reload, ported from upstream `SttExampleCard.js` / `ModelsCard.js` / `useModelCaps.js`).
- `web/src/components/combos/ModelPickerModal.svelte`: `normalizeCustoms`/`normalizeDisabled` now use the shared parser. Root cause of the reported bug: `GET /api/models/custom` returns `{models:[...]}` but the modal expected a bare array/record, so `fetchedCustoms` stayed `[]` and `oc/space-bunny-free` (custom-only, not in builtin `oc` catalog) never appeared in "tambah combo" — while the provider page (which already unwrapped `{models}`) showed it.
- `web/src/api/client.ts`: `getCustomModels`/`getDisabledModels` typed honestly (`{models:[...]}` / map) so future consumers stop guessing the envelope.
- `web/src/components/connections/types.ts`: `fetchProviderModelsData` uses the shared parser (same result as before, single code path).
- `web/src/components/media/MediaProviderDetail.svelte`: models card merges builtin + custom per kind (upstream `ModelsCard kindFilter` parity, builtin dedupe). Previously custom media models (`tts`/`stt`/`image`/`embedding`/`video`) never appeared.
- `web/src/components/media/SttExampleCard.svelte`: custom STT filter matches `storageAlias || providerId` (upstream uses `getProviderAlias`), reloads on `focus` + `customModelChanged` like upstream `loadCustom`.
- `web/src/components/connections/ProviderDetailView.svelte`: dispatches `customModelChanged` after every add/delete/import of a custom model (upstream `ModelsCard`/`page.js` parity), so pickers and STT cards refresh without full reload.
- Unchanged (already parity): `TtsExampleCard` stays builtin-only like upstream; backend `GET /models/disabled` bare-map shape kept, parser handles both.


## [v1.9.0] - 2026-09-25

### 🔀 Routing: antigravity-prefixed muse-spark Reaches the Owning Executor

- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`: `routeModelToOwningProvider` — a request like `ag/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` (prefix copied from a dashboard combo) now resolves to the provider that actually serves the model (opencode family) instead of antigravity, which answered upstream 404 `Requested entity was not found`. Native antigravity models are untouched. Ported from `fix/10` (`ad4b355b`), which never reached main. Tests: `TestRouteModelToOwningProvider`, `TestResolveModel_AntigravityMuseSparkRoutesToOpencode`.


### 🐛 Dashboard: Recent Requests List No Longer Blinks/Shrinks on First Request

- `internal/usagetracker/tracker.go`: seed the in-memory `recentRing` from `usageHistory` once per process (upstream `ensureRingInitialized` parity) + `recentFromHistoryRow` mapper. Previously a fresh process streamed a ring holding only post-restart rows, so the first completed request replaced the dashboard's DB-backed 20-row list with 1 row (list blinked, rows below vanished). Regression test `TestTracker_RingSeededFromHistoryOnce`.
- `web/src/components/analytics/AnalyticsView.svelte`: SSE `recentRequests` now merges (union + dedupe + newest-first + cap 20) instead of replacing, so a short stream payload can never drop rows already rendered.


### 🧹 Leak Hunt: 7 Fixes for 24/7 Operation (Independent Audit)

- `internal/shutdown/shutdown.go` + `internal/app/server.go`: new `shutdown.Context()` (canceled on `Cancel`); updater + catalog-sync loops take it instead of `context.Background()` — background goroutines + tickers now exit on ^C. Fixed `TestReset` double-close panic (recreate `done` channel).
- `internal/handlers/chat/combo_fusion.go`: `collectPanel`/`makePanelCall` take `ctx`; stragglers abort on grace/hard timeout, client cancel, or shutdown (previously `context.Background()`, orphaned until upstream responded).
- `internal/proxy/executor/freebuff_session.go` + `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_quota.go`: lazy eviction of expired entries + opportunistic sweep (2× TTL) — token-rotated keys no longer accumulate.
- `internal/handlers/chat/connections_proxy.go`: `proxyClients` capped at 128 with idle-close eviction (each entry pins a Transport + sockets).
- `internal/auth/session.go`: login limiter capped at 5000 buckets with window sweep + oldest-evict (scanner IPs bounded).
- `internal/handlers/chat/gemini_handler.go` + `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go`: 10MB caps on non-stream body reads and codex SSE accumulation.
- Out of scope (pre-existing, bounded): HeartbeatWriter ticker (dies with stream Close), tracing ring (2000), translator prune (50/10min), MITM conns (Wait).


### 🔊 Opencode Responses Errors Fail Loud (No More Silent Empty 200)

- `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go`: `ProcessCodexEvent` now records upstream `{"type":"error",...}` events (e.g. `FreeTierError` on muse-spark `-free` models) on stream state; `handleCodexStream` (non-stream) converts them to `*proxy.UpstreamError` (403 for free-tier/auth gates, else 502) instead of emitting `200 + content:""`. Silent success broke agents, bypassed account fallback/locks, and faked green monitoring. Upstream Next.js (`base.js`) likewise returns non-OK responses as errors, never empty 200s.
- Live evidence: `POST opencode.ai/zen/v1/responses` with `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` returns `FreeTierError: "OpenCode's free tier can only be used from within OpenCode"`.
- Limit (honest): on the already-committed SSE stream path headers cannot be unwound, so a pure-error stream still closes without chunks; the non-stream path (which agents use for the failing case) now errors properly.


### 🔗 Freebuff Cross-Process Session Coordination (Anti-Hijack)

- `internal/proxy/executor/freebuff_session.go` + `freebuff.go`: session lookup now memory L1 → `upstream_leases` L2; admission is coordinated — exactly one claimer per token+model across processes sharing the DB (`freebuffClaimMu` in-process + `AcquireLease` cross-process). Losers follow the winner's `instanceId` instead of POSTing their own claim (the pattern upstream punishes with 409 `session_superseded`). Stale-session retry drops the lease compare-and-delete (a sibling's fresh row survives). `Request.Leases` (nil = memory-only, old behavior) wired from chat fallback ×2, media `/responses`, and the session-switch endpoint.
- Tests: two racers converge on 1 POST (fake + real SQLite backends), follower reads with 0 POST, stale drop is compare-and-delete, nil-store contract unchanged.
- Note: coordination fixes *technical* hijacking between cooperating instances, not *policy* — two machines serving traffic concurrently on one account is still concurrent use server-side.


### ⬆️ Upstream v0.5.86 Parity (decolua/9router#v0.5.86)

- `internal/handlers/chat/claude_cloaking.go` + `internal/providers/providers.go`: bumped Claude CLI fingerprint `2.1.258` → `2.1.280` (upstream `cbffeb9`), so the billing-header cloak and `claude-cli/*` UA stay current. Added `claude-opus-5-5` to `cc`/`claude` catalogs (`registry_models.go`, `web/src/lib/models.ts`).
- `internal/handlers/media/deploy.go`: Vercel relay template now forwards headers losslessly (copy to plain object, strip only `x-relay-target`/`x-relay-path`/`host`) — upstream `6af26a9`. Cloaking headers survive relay pools, which matters for proxied Freebuff traffic.
- Deferred: Xiaomi MiMo v2.6 desktop login (5 region clusters, dual-route models, server-assisted flow) — large scope, tracked as separate stacked diff.

### 🛡️ Freebuff client_id Cloaking (Anti-Ban Parity)

- `internal/proxy/executor/freebuff.go`: `ForwardFreebuff` reuses the account's stored `fingerprintId` verbatim as `codebuff_metadata.client_id`, falling back to a fresh unbranded UUID only for connections saved before this change. Previously every chat request sent `client_id: "9router-<uuid>"`, which brands the traffic as non-CLI at the application layer — the most likely reason accounts got `banned` even though headers/User-Agent already matched the CLI. Note: cloaking only removes the self-identifying fingerprint; it cannot protect accounts banned for quota abuse, multi-account farming on one IP/fingerprint, or region violations.
- `internal/handlers/oauth/cline.go`: `decodeClineCode` now accepts the real browser-callback shape — base64url (`-`/`_` alphabet, padding stripped) plus the trailing signature segment the extension appends after the JSON payload. Previously only strict `StdEncoding` decoded, so pasting the callback failed to extract tokens and the handler fell through to `POST /api/v1/auth/token`, which the server rejects with `Forbidden` — exactly the reported `Cline token exchange failed ... Forbidden` error.
- `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go` + `internal/handlers/dashboard/connection_probe.go`: the `workos:` prefix is now JWT-only (WorkOS JWT = base64url `eyJ…` + dot, upstream parity `open-sse/shared/clineAuth.js`). Non-JWT ClinePass API keys ride plain `Bearer` — prefixing them is what the server answers with 401 `"Unauthorized: Please make sure you're using the latest version of Cline and re-authenticate your Cline account."` Note: your pasted bundle decodes to a real WorkOS JWT (`eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InNzb19vaWRj...`, `expiresAt` already past `2026-09-24T07:23:51Z`), so that specific token is expired server-side — reconnect with a fresh browser login after updating.
- `internal/handlers/oauth/cline.go`: new Cline/ClinePass connections are named by account email from the token bundle (fallback: first+last name, then provider default) instead of the generic `ClinePass` label, so multi-account setups stay distinguishable in provider detail.
- All-providers branding sweep (no behavior change otherwise): audited every header/body sent to upstream. Only one real leak found and removed — `User-Agent: 9router/oauth` on the Antigravity Google token exchange (`internal/handlers/oauth/antigravity.go`), now unbranded Go default. Everything else already mirrors an official client: Freebuff `codebuff-cli/*` + fingerprinted `client_id` (no `9router-` anywhere on the wire), Cline `Cline/*` + `cline-cli`, Antigravity `antigravity/ide/*`, Gemini CLI `google-api-nodejs-client/*`, Grok/Codex/iFlow/Qoder/MiMo browser or CLI UAs, TTS browser UAs. `X-Msh-Platform: 9router` (Kimi) and `HTTP-Referer/X-Title: endpoint-proxy.local / Endpoint Proxy` (OpenRouter/Airforce) are byte-identical to upstream `decolua/9router` — changing them would *break* parity, not improve stealth. `User-Agent: 9Router` only ever hits the user's own proxy-test target and GitHub API (never an LLM provider). Local-only strings (`9router-oauth` BroadcastChannel, MITM CA, updater UA, file paths) never leave the machine.
- `internal/handlers/oauth/naming.go` (new) + all OAuth handlers (`freebuff.go`, `cline.go`, `antigravity.go`, `trae.go`, `windsurf.go`, `zed.go`, `authcode.go`, `pkce.go`, `device.go`): single email-first naming rule `connectionDisplayName` — account email when known, else explicit user-supplied name, else provider default. No more `"Provider (name)"` labels anywhere, so every provider detail page (Freebuff, ClinePass, Antigravity, …) lists accounts by email.
**Production Internet Hardening & Cloudflare Integration:**
- **Protect `/debug/pprof/*` endpoints**: Disabled Go runtime profiling endpoints (`/debug/pprof/*`) by default in production to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) and potential memory/key disclosures. Can be explicitly enabled via `PPROF_ENABLED=true`.
- **Privilege separation for client API keys**: Restricted destructive administrative routes (`/api/version/shutdown`, `/api/version/update`, `/api/settings/database`, `/admin/health/reset`) so they strictly require a valid dashboard JWT session cookie or local CLI token (`x-9r-cli-token`), matching upstream `ALWAYS_PROTECTED` behavior in `src/dashboardGuard.js`. Client API keys can no longer trigger shutdowns or database dumps.
- **Cloudflare `CF-Connecting-IP` support**: Updated `LoginClientIP` in `internal/auth/session.go` to support `CF-Connecting-IP` when `TRUST_PROXY=true` or `TRUST_CLOUDFLARE=true`, ensuring proper client IP resolution and preventing shared-bucket lockout behind Cloudflare.
- **Configurable host binding (`HOST` / `BIND_ADDR`)**: Added `Host` to configuration and updated server listener to bind to `HOST` or `BIND_ADDR` when specified (e.g. `127.0.0.1` when proxied by `cloudflared`), while preserving `:20130` (`0.0.0.0`) default behavior.

### 🎨 UI & Dashboard

**Media Providers Full Parity (`/dashboard/media-providers/*`):**
- `internal/handlers/media/tts_synthesizers.go` & `tts_forward.go`: Built local native synthesis engines (`edge-tts`, `google-tts`, `nvidia`) and voice catalog endpoints (`/api/media-providers/tts/voices`), supporting real-time streaming audio generation and custom speed/pitch/voice options.
- `internal/handlers/media/antigravity_image.go` & `antigravity_stt.go`: Added Antigravity image generation and speech-to-text (STT) transcription handlers with multipart form-data parsing, extracting audio models and delegating to Google's IDE backend.
- `internal/handlers/media/antigravity_search.go`: Ensured typed JSON serialization for Antigravity web search requests and responses to match upstream key ordering and structure.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`: Fixed System One endpoint `/v1/systemone` to handle `x-antigravity-session` headers and fall back seamlessly to direct connections with `public` default keys for `antigravity-zen`.
- `web/src/components/media/MediaKindView.svelte`, `MediaProviderCard.svelte`, `NoAuthProxyCard.svelte`, `TtsExampleCard.svelte`, and `SttExampleCard.svelte`: Full Svelte 5 runes parity with upstream Next.js for all 8 media kinds (`video`, `stt`, `tts`, `image`, `embedding`, `systemone`, `webSearch`, `webFetch`), aligning provider sorting, priority, hidden flags, and live audio/waveform test players.

**Antigravity Live Models Discovery & "Import from /models":**
- `internal/providers/registry_models.go` & `web/src/lib/models.ts`: Added Google Antigravity official live models (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash-thinking`, `gemini-3.1-pro-high`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`).
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/connections.go`: Extended `GET /api/providers/:id/models` to support Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Cline, and ClinePass connections. For Antigravity, queries Google's live RPC (`https://daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:fetchAvailableModels`) with Bearer tokens, filtering internal chat IDs and parsing vision/reasoning capabilities.
- `web/src/components/connections/ProviderDetailView.svelte`:
  - Added `[📥 Import from /models]` button next to `Add Model` for Antigravity, Cline, ClinePass, and Qoder accounts.
  - Auto-fetches live models from Google for active Antigravity connections on page load, displaying uncataloged models in the **Suggested models** section for 1-click addition.

**Suggested Free Models Feed & Custom Models Parity:**
- `internal/handlers/suggestedmodels.go`: Wrapped HTTP client in `proxy.NewFallbackTransport` so public model catalog feeds (`opencode`, `openrouter`, `kilocode`, `airforce`) never get blocked by sandbox proxy allowlists.
- `web/src/lib/providers.ts`: Added `modelsFetcher: { url: "https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models", type: "opencode-free" }` to `opencode`, restoring the "Suggested free models (≥200k context)" section on OpenCode Free.
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/models.go`: Updated `GET /api/models/custom` to return `{ "models": [...] }` matching upstream Next.js shape, and updated `web/src/components/connections/types.ts` to cleanly parse custom model lists without type-assertion errors.

**Universal Outbound Direct Fallback & Proxy Allowlist Bypass:**
- `internal/proxy/fallback_transport.go`: Created `FallbackTransport` which wraps Go HTTP round-trippers to detect local proxy refusal (`403 Forbidden`, `blocked-by-allowlist`, `CONNECT tunnel failed`, or proxy text/plain errors) and instantly re-issue the request directly (`Proxy: nil`) with re-readable request bodies.
- Applied universally across chat resolution, streaming SSE forwarders, media endpoints, validation probes, and catalog feeds.

**Comprehensive Connection Health Probing & Zero False Errors:**
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/connection_probe.go`:
  - Added native probe configurations for OAuth providers (`antigravity`, `gemini-cli`, `cline`, `clinepass`, `freebuff`, `xai`, `grok-cli`, `codebuddy-intl`, `zed`, `windsurf`, `trae`, `devin`, `devin-cli`, etc.).
  - Implemented token-exists heuristic for unconfigured providers and compatible base-URL probing for custom nodes.
  - Fixed `persistProbeResult` so that informational "Provider test not supported" messages no longer falsely mark connections as `testStatus: "error"` or pollute `lastError` in the SQLite database.
  - Updated Cline / ClinePass probe to prefix WorkOS JWT tokens with `workos:`.

**Quota Tracker Full Parity with Upstream Next.js (`/dashboard/quota`):**
- `internal/handlers/router.go`: Mounted `/api/usage/{connectionId}`, `/api/usage/providers`, `/api/usage/stream`, `/api/usage/stats`, and `/api/usage/request-details` inside `SetupDashboardRoutes` with `RequireDashboardAuth`, allowing authenticated browser sessions (JWT cookie), local CLI tokens, and client API keys to fetch quota and usage details.
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/usage_providers.go`: Enhanced `fetchAntigravityDashboardWeekly` to parse both session (5h) and weekly quota buckets from Google's `retrieveUserQuotaSummary`, and added reconciliation when all Gemini models are exhausted (matching upstream `open-sse/services/usage/antigravity-weekly.js` and `google.js`).
- `web/package.json` & `web/src/main.ts`: Added and bundled `material-symbols/outlined.css` locally, ensuring all icons (refresh, edit, delete, eye-off, hourglass, toggle) render instantly and work 100% offline without text flashing.
- `web/src/components/quota/types.ts`: Implemented full upstream provider quota parser `parseQuotaData` supporting Antigravity (5-quota family grouping: Gemini 5h, Claude & GPT 5h, Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, Gemini Weekly, Claude & GPT Weekly), Codex, Kiro, Qoder, Claude, DeepSeek, Groq, Ollama, and Zed, with model catalog canonical sorting.
- `web/src/components/QuotaTrackerView.svelte`:
  - Added secondary connection label (`getConnectionSecondaryLabel`) for accounts with different emails/display names.
  - Aligned status badges to only render on Kiro connections (matching upstream Next.js).
  - Added connection edit action (pencil icon) with interactive `Edit Connection` modal (name & priority editing + reachability test).
  - Added auto-ping toggle (`bolt` icon) for Claude & Codex OAuth accounts and Codex reset credits integration.


**Token Saver Full Parity with Upstream Next.js (`/dashboard/token-saver`):**
- `internal/handlers/router.go`: Mounted `/api/headroom/*` (`status`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `extras`, and `proxy`) inside `SetupDashboardRoutes` with `RequireDashboardAuth`, allowing dashboard session cookies to query and control Headroom proxy lifecycle.
- `web/src/api/client.ts`: Updated `HeadroomStatusResponse` and `HeadroomExtrasResponse`, adding `getHeadroomExtras()`, `startHeadroom()`, `stopHeadroom()`, `restartHeadroom()`, `installHeadroomExtras()`, and `uninstallHeadroomExtras()`.
- `web/src/components/TokenSaverView.svelte`:
  - Removed duplicate in-page header (`PiggyBank` banner) to align with upstream Next.js header layout where page title & icon live in `TopBar`.
  - Replaced custom dialog with standard `Modal.svelte` featuring macOS-style traffic lights (`#FF5F56`), backdrop blur, and `Button.svelte`/`Input.svelte` components.
  - Implemented full Headroom status detection (`Checking…`, `Running`, `Not installed`, `Stopped`, `External`) with local/managed PID checks.
  - Added Headroom compression extras (`[code]`, `[ml]`), install confirmation modal (warning on 1GB ML download), pip uninstall, and log tail streaming.
  - Added locale-based Wenyan level filtering for Caveman output compressor (only showing classical Chinese compression levels on `zh` locales).


**Freebuff Multi-Account Session Management & Direct Proxy Fallback:**
- `internal/proxy/executor/freebuff_session.go` & `freebuff.go`: Added `DoFreebuffHTTP` with automatic fallback to direct connection (`Proxy: nil`) when local or environment proxies refuse requests to `codebuff.com` / `freebuff.com` (`403 Forbidden` / `blocked-by-allowlist`), preventing session lookups and admissions from failing.
- `internal/handlers/oauth/freebuff_session.go` & `freebuff_session_switch.go`: Automatically syncs active session models (`currentModel`) into `conn.Data` (`freebuffModel` and `assignedModel`) in SQLite, enabling strict model routing per connection.
- `web/src/components/connections/FreebuffSessionBanner.svelte`: Added multi-account selection pills allowing users to view and switch between different Freebuff accounts and their respective sessions directly from the banner.
- `web/src/components/connections/ProviderDetailView.svelte`: Added per-connection session badges (`🔒 model-id`, `queued`, `banned`, `no session`) on connection cards with a dedicated **Session** button (`lock_clock`) to quickly focus and manage any account's active seat.

**Vision & Audio Adapter Full Parity (`/dashboard/combos`):**
- `web/src/lib/models.ts`:
  - Updated `getModelCaps` to detect `audioInput` capability and refined vision detection by eliminating false positives from bare `"flash"` model ID tokens (which previously caused non-vision models like `deepseek-v4-flash` to be incorrectly classified as vision-capable).
  - Aligned vision patterns with upstream `visionPatterns.js` (`looksLikeVisionModel`), filtering out audio/tts/stt/embedding generators while identifying multi-modal vision families (`gemini`, `4o`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-6`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku-4.5`, `fable`, `kimi`, `minimax`, `mimo`, `qwen`, `grok`, `llama-4`, `muse-spark`).
- `web/src/components/combos/pickerData.ts`:
  - Added `caps.audioInput` to `PickerModel`.
  - Strictly enforced modality filtering in `resolveFilteredGroups`: `target === 'vision'` now filters exclusively for models with `caps.vision === true`, and `target === 'audio'` filters exclusively for `caps.audioInput === true`, regardless of whether a search query is active.
  - Added empty state handler displaying `No models found` with search icon when no models in the active catalog match the modality requirement.
- `web/src/components/combos/CapacityAdapterSection.svelte`:
  - Removed redundant summary bullet list above cards to match upstream Next.js header layout.
  - Aligned subtitles to `— images (png, jpg, webp, …)` and `— audio input`.
  - Standardized icons to Material Symbols `visibility` (eye) and `graphic_eq` (sound wave equalizer).
- `internal/db/settings.go`: Added `CapacityAdapterEntry` and `CapacityAdapter map[string]CapacityAdapterEntry` to `SettingsData` with default fallback to `ag/gemini-3.8-flash-high`.
- `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go`: Implemented `AugmentModelsWithCapacityAdapter` to automatically prepend models from the capacity adapter pool when none of the target models support required input modalities (e.g. vision for image inputs).
- `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go`: Integrated capacity adapter auto-switch into both OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` and Anthropic `/v1/messages` for both combos and single-model requests.
- `internal/handlers/chat/vision_adapter_e2e_test.go`: Added comprehensive E2E tests verifying automatic switching from text-only models (`deepseek/deepseek-chat`) to vision-capable models (`ag/gemini-3.8-flash-high`) when image inputs are present in OpenAI and Anthropic request formats.

**Change Log in-app modal (upstream Next.js parity):**
- `web/src/components/ChangelogModal.svelte`: Added `ChangelogModal` Svelte 5 component with markdown parsing via `marked`, custom scrollable container, loading/error states with retry, backdrop-blur overlay, and links to GitHub Releases & Changelog history.
- `web/src/components/TopBar.svelte`: Changed the App Drawer item under "Theme" from an external link to a button triggering the in-app `ChangelogModal`, matching upstream Next.js `HeaderMenu` behavior.
- `web/src/api/client.ts`: Added `api.getChangelog()` querying `/api/changelog` with fallback to GitHub raw URLs.
- `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go` + `internal/handlers/router.go`: Added `GET /api/changelog` and `GET /changelog` endpoints to serve the application changelog directly from local disk with remote fallback.
- `web/src/index.css`: Added `.changelog-body` markdown typography and badge styles.

**Update notification banner in Sidebar (upstream Next.js parity):**
- `web/src/components/Sidebar.svelte`: Added update notification banner below the version label (`↑ New version available: v{latestVersion}`) with `Update now` button and clickable `9router-go update` command pill, matching upstream Next.js `Sidebar.js`.
- Added interactive Update modal with release notes, one-click auto-updater (`api.triggerUpdate()`), manual copy command with countdown shutdown, and disconnected reconnect overlay.
- `web/src/api/client.ts`: Added `SystemVersionInfo` type, `checkUpdate()`, `triggerUpdate()`, and `shutdownServer()`.

**Remove 9Remote & 9English; align Support 9Router with 9router-go repo:**
- `web/src/components/Sidebar.svelte`: Removed the `9Remote` action button & modal and `9English` external link from navigation items; cleaned up modal markup and unused `isRemoteModalOpen` state.
- `web/src/components/TopBar.svelte`: Updated the "Support 9Router" modal to remove the external 9English project link and point to the `9router-go` repository ([`https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go`](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go)) and Releases page ([`/releases`](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/releases)).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**OpenCode Chat Completions Tool Fingerprint & Model Purity (`space-bunny-free`):**
- `internal/translator/fingerprint.go`: Fixed `ConcealFingerprintTools` to preserve standard Chat Completions tool shape (`{"type":"function","function":{"name":...}}`) with `"tool_choice":"none"` when client tools are absent, instead of falling back to flat Responses format (`{"type":"function","name":...}`) which caused upstream `[invalid_request_error] invalid request` on OpenCode Chat Completions models like `space-bunny-free`.
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go`: Stripped provider prefixes (`oc/`, `opencode/`) from `model` in `ForwardOpencode` and `ForwardOpencodeGo` before forwarding upstream.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`: Removed hardcoded model rewrites (`strings.Contains(model, "muse-spark")`, etc.) from Antigravity resolution; all `ag/` and `antigravity/` models resolve cleanly to `antigravity` without special-case overrides.
- `web/src/components/connections/ProviderDetailView.svelte`: Restricted `suggestedModels` strictly to providers that declare a public `modelsFetcher` (upstream Next.js parity). Removed artificial suggested models injection under Antigravity so OpenCode models no longer leak into Antigravity's view.

**Antigravity Google OAuth Callback percent-encoding unescape:**
- `internal/handlers/oauth/antigravity.go`: Added `cleanAuthCode` to unescape double-encoded slashes (`4/0A...` vs `4%252F...`) and strip raw URL parameter prefixes before submitting `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` token exchange requests to Google.
- `web/src/components/connections/ProviderDetailView.svelte`: Added `decodeURIComponent` input cleansing for pasted OAuth authorization callback URLs.

**Deep Auth Verification for OpenAI-Compatible Custom Nodes:**
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/validate.go`: Added a secondary 1-token probe to `POST /v1/chat/completions` during provider node validation (`validateOpenAICompatibleNode`), preventing mock or unauthenticated servers from returning false positive validation results.

**Fix Round-Robin routing for combos and provider connections (Issue #20):**
- `internal/db/settings.go`: Updated `SettingsData` and `GetSettings()` to parse both dashboard JSON keys (`fallbackStrategy` / `rotateStrategy` and `stickyRoundRobinLimit` / `stickyLimit`), as well as global `fallbackStrategy`, `stickyRoundRobinLimit`, `comboStrategy`, `comboStickyRoundRobinLimit`, and `comboStrategies`.
- `internal/db/settings.go`: Updated `SetProviderStrategy` and added `SetComboStrategy` to write to `settings.data` via `UpdateSettingsRaw` without clobbering other settings fields.
- `internal/db/repos.go`: Updated `GetComboByName`, `GetComboById`, and `GetCombos` to populate `combo.Strategy` from `settings.comboStrategies[combo.Name]` and global `settings.comboStrategy`.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`: Added `resolveComboRouting` so `ResolveModel` and `resolveModelEntry` populate `ModelInfo.Strategy`, `ModelInfo.StickyLimit`, and `ModelInfo.JudgeModel` from `settings.comboStrategies` or global combo settings.
- `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go` & `fallback.go`: Updated provider connection selection to rotate active connections using `fallbackStrategy` or global fallback settings when configured to `"round-robin"`.
- Added unit tests in `internal/db/settings_test.go` and `internal/handlers/chat/connection_strategy_test.go` covering combo strategy resolution, sticky limits, judge models, and provider connection rotation.

**Fix fetch stream double-read in `web/src/api/client.ts` and add missing tunnel endpoint handlers:**
- `web/src/api/client.ts`: Resolved `Failed to execute 'text' on 'Response': body stream already read` error when receiving non-2xx responses. Previously, `res.json()` consumed the stream body on error responses, which caused the subsequent `res.text()` fallback in the catch block to crash. The client now safely reads `res.text()` first before attempting JSON parsing.
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/tunnel.go` & `internal/handlers/router.go`: Added endpoints `POST /api/tunnel/enable`, `POST /api/tunnel/disable`, `GET /api/tunnel/tailscale-check`, `POST /api/tunnel/tailscale-enable`, and `POST /api/tunnel/tailscale-disable` with structured JSON responses and clean error handling instead of unhandled 404s.

**Combo bypass Vercel Edge Relay for no-auth providers (e.g. `oc/muse-spark-1.3` 429 on `combo-wombo`, solo test 200):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go` (chat + messages fallback) and `combo_fusion.go` — no-auth branch now sets `ProxyPoolID: h.ResolveProviderProxyPoolID(modelInfo.Provider)` (was `&ConnectionData{APIKey}` only), so combo routing goes through the configured `providerStrategies.<provider>.proxyPoolId` relay (`x-relay-target`/`x-relay-path`) exactly like the solo path (`handleAccountFallback`). Direct-to-`https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/responses` calls that burned the free-tier IP quota (`FreeUsageLimitError` 429) are eliminated.

**Vercel Edge Relay header forwarding for `muse-spark` / `antigravity`:**
- `internal/proxy/opencode.go` — `BuildOpenCodeHeaders` preserves `x-relay-target` / `x-relay-path` instead of dropping them.
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — `ForwardOpencode` / `ForwardOpencodeGo` keep `BaseURL` on the relay host and route via `x-relay-path` (`/zen/v1/responses`, `/zen/v1/messages`, `/zen/go/v1/responses`) when relay headers are present.
- Added `TestForwardOpencode_MuseSpark_EdgeRelay` (PASS); verified live `200 OK` via relay.

**Topology false pulse on dashboard load (`AnalyticsView.svelte`):**
- SSE `/api/usage/stream` initial snapshot no longer triggers the electric-beam animation: added `streamInitialized` guard so only genuine new model requests after init pulse; active-request updates set `lastProvider` without re-pulsing. Dashboard API traffic (`/api/usage`, polling) never triggers topology effects — only upstream model calls do.
- Consolidated per-node SVG turbulence filters into one lightweight global filter (`numOctaves="1"`) for GPU/CPU relief during continuous animation.

**Query-param auth for SSE streams (`internal/middleware/auth.go`):**
- `ExtractApiKey` accepts `?key=` / `?apiKey=` on routes ending in `/stream` (native `EventSource` can't set custom headers); REST/LLM endpoints stay header-only.

**Topology Option A visuals (`ProviderTopologyCard.svelte` + `web/src/index.css`):**
- Bidirectional neural stream (cyan prompt Router→Provider, emerald/gold response Provider→Router), dual shockwave rings on the active provider target, router absorption rings, node micro-bounce + `LIVE` badge.

### 🔄 Upstream Parity Sync

**Strike-breaker quota-only (upstream `decolua/9router#4197` parity, PR #16):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_quota.go` — `HandleAntigravityQuotaError` now takes the upstream `errorMessage` and only counts a strike on explicit quota markers (`RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`, `Individual quota reached`). Generic bare `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` 429s no longer burn strikes / lock combos.
- `internal/handlers/chat/gemini_handler.go` — forwards `string(uErr.Body)` as the error message source.
- Added `TestAntigravityQuota_Generic429NoStrike` regression test.

**Refusal → content_filter mapping (upstream `decolua/9router#4210` parity, PR #16):**
- `internal/translator/claude_response.go` — streaming + non-streaming: Gemini `refusal` finish maps to `content_filter`, emits `stop_details.explanation` so Claude Code renders the block instead of hanging.
- `internal/translator/response.go` — reverse mapping `content_filter → refusal` for round-trips.
- Added refusal stream / non-stream / round-trip tests.

**Weekly vs session quota buckets (upstream `decolua/9router#4209` parity, PR #18):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_quota.go` — `ParseWeeklyQuotaSummary` classifies the `window` field into weekly (`gemini`/`claude_gpt`) vs 5h-session (`gemini_session`/`claude_gpt_session`) buckets; `IsAntigravityModelBlocked` honors session buckets via `quotaEntryExhausted` helper.
- Added `TestAntigravityWeeklyQuota_SessionBuckets`.

**Add Compatible modal + provider-node validation (upstream `AddCompatibleModal.js` + `provider-nodes/validate/route.js` parity):**
- `web/src/components/connections/AddCompatibleNodeModal.svelte` — rebuilt to match the upstream modal: separate `Name` / `Prefix` / `API Type` fields with upstream placeholders (`OpenAI Compatible (Prod)`, `oc-prod`, …) and hints, `API Key (for Check)` + `Model ID (optional)` inputs driving a `Check` button with `Valid` / `Invalid` badges (chat-fallback note included), and full-width `Create` + `Cancel`. The API key is now validation-only and no longer auto-creates a connection (`ConnectionsView.svelte`).
- `internal/handlers/dashboard/provider_nodes.go` + `router.go` / `routes.go` — added `POST /api/provider-nodes/validate` (OpenAI-compatible `/models` + chat fallback, Anthropic-compatible with `x-api-key` + `/messages`-suffix strip, `custom-embedding` with dimension report), including SSRF guard for non-loopback callers (`handlerutil.AssertPublicURL`).
- `web/src/api/client.ts` — added `validateProviderNode`.
- Added `provider_nodes_validate_test.go` (13 tests: input guards, SSRF/local, OpenAI/Anthropic/embedding probes, chat fallback, network-error mapping).

### 🧹 Style Cleanup (behavior-neutral, PR #17 + follow-ups)

- `interface{}` → `any` across production code and test files; `errors.New` + `%w` wrapping; `slices.Contains/Sorted/Delete`, builtin `max()`/`clear()`, `strings.Builder`, shared header constants in `internal/constants`.
- Named constants: `antigravityDecoyUnavailable`, `maxReadLimit`, `thinkingHeadroomTokens`, `maxCallIDLen`, `MaxUpstreamBodyBytes`/`UpstreamErrLimit`.
- `fallback.go` — `forwardRequestParams` struct replaces 10-param forwarding; `openai.go` — `sseStreamOpts` struct replaces 8-param SSE helper.
- `antigravity_quota.go` — `AntigravityQuotaError` struct + named quota markers (replaces `map[string]any` error plumbing).
- Added `samber/lo` (`Ternary`, `CoalesceOrEmpty` only — `Coalesce` on `any` maps and eager `Ternary` slicing deliberately avoided).
- Default port `20128` → `20130` (`config.go`, `Makefile`, `mitm/handlers/base.go`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`).

### 🧪 Tests

- `gemini38_live_test.go` — real upstream tests for `ag/gemini-3.8-flash-medium` (chat + stream, `200 OK`). Live E2E: 17/17 PASS.

### 📦 Release Hardening (issue #19)

- `make cross` generates `SHA256SUMS.txt`, uploaded by `release.yml`; README documents the Windows Defender false-positive (`Wacatac.C!ml` heuristic on the unsigned binary) with verify + Allow steps.


## [v1.8.18] — 2026-09-21

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**OMP Harness False-429 on Antigravity (upstream `decolua/9router#3986` parity):**
- `internal/translator/antigravity.go` — `WrapForAntigravity` no longer sends `requestType: "agent"` in the Cloud Code envelope (`AntigravityRequest.RequestType` is now `omitempty` and left empty). Google enforces a tiny separate quota bucket whenever `requestType="agent"` is present, so OMP (Oh My Pi) harness payloads (~25–30k token system prompt + tools) were rejected with false `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` even with quota remaining — cascading into `CACHE_BLOCK` account locks while Claude Code stayed green. Verified live: same payload returns `200 OK` after the fix.
- `internal/translator/antigravity_test.go` — Added `TestWrapForAntigravity_OmitsAgentRequestType` regression test (asserts the field is absent from the raw envelope JSON and the `requestId` `agent/<…>` shape is preserved). Image (`image_gen`) and search (`search`) request types are untouched.

### 🔄 Upstream Parity Sync — `decolua/9router` v0.5.75…v0.5.81 (100%)

**Model Catalog & Routing:**
- `internal/providers/registry_models.go` — Registered `deepseek-v4.1-flash` for `codebuddy-intl` (`cbai`, replacing the retired `deepseek-v4-flash`) and added `deepseek-v4.1-flash:cloud` to the `ollama` catalog.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go` — Routed bare `codex-auto-review` to the `codex` provider (PR #4135 parity), resolved even with a nil repo / empty DB.

**Antigravity Hygiene:**
- `internal/translator/antigravity.go` — Stripped the Claude Code `x-anthropic-billing-header` from system prompts and sanitized the Hermes Agent identity (`You are Hermes Agent, an intelligent AI assistant created by Nous Research.` → neutral form) to eliminate false HTTP 429/403 anti-abuse rejections.
- `internal/translator/thought_signature_store.go` — Scoped cached Gemini thought signatures to the producing model family (`claude` vs `gemini`), preventing cross-family replay that triggers HTTP 400 `Invalid thought signature` when a conversation switches models (upstream `bc3be0cb` parity).
- `internal/translator/gemini.go` — Threaded the model name through the `GetGeminiThoughtSignature` / `StoreGeminiThoughtSignature` call sites so stored signatures are keyed per model family (call-site half of the scoping above).

**CommandCode Multimodal & Reasoning:**
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Added native image blocks to `buildCommandcodeBody`: OpenAI `image_url` data URIs and Claude/OpenAI base64 image sources are converted to CommandCode `{type: "image", image: <dataUri>, mimeType}` blocks, and `reasoning_effort` (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`max`) is preserved on `/alpha/generate`.

**Union-Alpha / OpenCode Parity (verified):**
- Confirmed live routing of `oc/union-alpha` through the Anthropic Messages API (`/zen/v1/messages`) with `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` and automatic `max_tokens` injection (PR #4099 parity); free-tier `forceStream`/SSE aggregation parity already structural in Go.
- `internal/handlers/chat/muse_spark_e2e_test.go` — Added `TestIntegration_OpenCode_UnionAlpha_Messages` (live E2E; SKIPs on upstream rate-limit or auth-dependent `Model union-alpha is not supported` 401, consistent with existing Muse Spark E2E policy).

## [v1.8.17] — 2026-09-18

### 🚀 Features & Upstream Parity

**Claude OAuth Subscription (`sk-ant-oat`) Support End-to-End (PR #13):**
- Contributed by **@rezhajulio** ([#13](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/pull/13)) — Special thanks for bringing full Claude Pro/Max subscription parity from the dashboard to the native Go proxy!
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` — Automatic header switching to `Authorization: Bearer` and appending `?beta=true` for Claude OAuth credentials (`sk-ant-oat` or `accessToken`), supporting direct Anthropic API as well as Edge Relay proxy pools.
- `internal/handlers/chat/claude_cloaking.go` — Injected official `x-anthropic-billing-header` into `system[0]`, deterministic account `metadata.user_id`, client tool name obfuscation with `_ide` suffix, and decoy tools (`CCDecoyTools`) preventing false HTTP 429 anti-abuse rate limits.
- `internal/proxy/executor/claude_decloak.go` — Streaming and non-streaming response decloaker restoring original tool names and translating decoy tool invocations into clean text blocks.
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Added `sanitizeToolUseID` to rewrite foreign/Gemini tool IDs deterministically to Anthropic-compliant `toolu_<sha256>`.
- `internal/tokensaver/prompts.go` — Added `InjectSystemPromptClaude` for format-aware system prompt injection at top-level `system`.

**Antigravity Zen Free-Tier Tool Quartet Renaming (PR #12):**
- Contributed by **@yxxrn** ([#12](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/pull/12)) — Special thanks for identifying the exact upstream fingerprinting gate and eliminating Claude Code 403/500 errors!
- `internal/translator/fingerprint.go` — Implemented `ConcealFingerprintTools` to rename uppercase tool quartet variants from Claude Code CLI (`Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Read`) to canonical lowercase (`bash`, `glob`, `grep`, `read`), eliminate duplicates (preventing upstream HTTP 500), retarget `tool_choice`, and restore original tool names in response payloads via `RestoreToolNamesInPayload` / `RestoreToolNamesInSSE`.
- `internal/proxy/executor/toolname_writer.go` — Embedded `toolNameRestoringWriter` on responses ensuring client tools are seamlessly restored across both streaming and non-streaming responses.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

**CommandCode CLI User-Agent & Schema Wrapping (PR #14, fixes #9):**
- Reported by **@jhonoryza** ([#9](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/issues/9)) — Thank you for reporting the Cloudflare challenge error!
- `internal/providers/providers.go` & `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Added official `User-Agent: commandcode/0.25.7 (cli)` and `x-command-code-version: 0.25.7`, eliminating Cloudflare WAF bot-challenge intercepts (HTTP 403 `Attention Required!`).
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Implemented `buildCommandcodeBody` wrapping OpenAI payloads into `{threadId, memory, config, params}` schema required by CommandCode's `/alpha/generate` endpoint.
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` & `internal/proxy/proxy.go` — Enhanced error parsing in `extractErrorText` and `UpstreamError.Error()` to summarize Cloudflare challenge pages cleanly without dumping raw HTML.

**Responses API (`POST /v1/responses`) Public Provider Fallback & String Input (PR #15, fixes #10):**
- Reported by **@pankaj-raikar** ([#10](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/issues/10)) — Thank you for the detailed reproduction report!
- `internal/handlers/media/media.go` — Added automatic fallback for public/free-tier providers (`DefaultAPIKey: "public"`) in `forwardMediaRequest`, eliminating `"no active connections for provider: opencode"` when no SQLite connection is seeded.
- `internal/handlers/media/media.go` & `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go` — Routed `opencode`, `opencode-go`, and `antigravity/muse-spark-*` models on `/responses` directly to `ForwardOpencode` so session tracking, request headers, and tool-name concealing work out of the box.
- `internal/proxy/executor/transform.go` — Updated `buildResponsesBody` to support both string inputs (`"input": "Say hello"`) and array inputs (`Input []any`), normalizing string prompts into valid Responses message items.

## [v1.8.16] — 2026-09-17

### 🐛 Upstream Parity & Bug Fixes

**Active Provider Connections & Capabilities on `/v1/models` and `/api/models` (PR #8, fixes #7):**
- `internal/providers/registry_models.go` — Added comprehensive upstream provider models registry mapped from 128 provider definitions (`decolua/9router` parity) with `GetProviderModels()`.
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` — Implemented `CapabilitiesDetail` and `GetCapabilitiesDetailForModel()`, outputting full multimodal flags (`vision`, `pdf`, `audioInput`, `videoInput`, `imageOutput`, `audioOutput`), `thinkingCanDisable`, and dual token limits (`contextWindows` and `contextWindow`).
- `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go` — Replaced empty `/v1/models` responses by dynamically aggregating models for active connections (`isActive = 1`), honoring custom prefixes and connection-enabled models. Custom models from deactivated connections (`disabledProviders`) are automatically excluded, and clean static catalogs are returned when no database connections are configured.
- `internal/handlers/router.go` — Mounted `GET /api/models` and `GET /api/models/*` serving both `"data"` and `"models"` top-level keys for universal compatibility across OpenAI-compliant IDE clients and Next.js web dashboards.
- `internal/handlers/chat/models_provider_test.go` — Added regression tests verifying model discovery for active Codex (`cx`) connections, fallback registry, and single-model lookups.

## [v1.8.15] — 2026-09-17

### 🚀 Features & Upstream Parity

**Claude Messages to OpenAI Response Translation for Zen / Union-Alpha (PR #4099, #4111):**
- `internal/translator/claude_response.go` — Added on-the-fly streaming (`TranslateClaudeChunkToOpenAI`) and non-streaming (`TranslateClaudeResponseToOpenAI`) response translation engines. Transforms Claude Messages SSE events (`content_block_delta`, `thinking_delta`, `tool_use`, `input_json_delta`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`) into standard OpenAI chunks (`choices[0].delta.content`, `reasoning_content`, `tool_calls`) so that client harnesses (e.g. omp, Cursor, Cline) receive native responses.
- `internal/proxy/executor/claude_messages.go` — Added dedicated streaming handler (`handleClaudeMessagesStream`) and non-streaming handler (`handleClaudeMessagesNonStream`) wired into `ForwardOpencode` and `ForwardOpencodeGo` for `union-alpha` routes.
- `internal/proxy/opencode.go` — Updated Antigravity Zen headers to comply with upstream PR #4111 (`User-Agent: antigravity/1.18.31 ai-sdk/provider-utils/4.0.46 runtime/bun/1.3.14`, `x-antigravity-client: cli`, dynamic 40-character hex project IDs `GenerateOpenCodeProjectID()`, and `x-api-key: public`).

**Anthropic Tools & Messages Schema Normalization:**
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Added `convertOpenAIToolsToClaude`, `ensureMessagesMaxTokens`, `extractClaudeSystemPrompt`, and `convertOpenAIMessagesToClaude` to convert incoming OpenAI tool definitions (`type: "function"`) into Claude tools (`{name, description, input_schema}`), normalize `tool_choice`, and merge adjacent same-role messages for compliant Anthropic payload delivery.
- `internal/proxy/sse.go` — Expanded terminal detection buffer to 64 bytes and added recognition for Anthropic terminal signals (`"stop_reason":` non-null and `"message_stop"`) to eliminate premature `finish_reason: "network_error"` synthesis at clean stream EOF.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Resilience

**Google RPC `quotaResetDelay` Automatic Duration Locking with Deadlock Prevention:**
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` — Implemented `extractResetDuration` to parse Google RPC ErrorInfo metadata `quotaResetDelay` (e.g. `"1h12m28.109534319s"`) and text patterns (`"Resets in XhYmZs."`). Enforces safety bounds (min 5s, hard cap at 2 hours) to avoid perpetual lockouts or deadlocks.
- `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go` — Updated `comboLockRetryable` to use the parsed reset duration for connection and model locks instead of falling back to 8s exponential backoff.
- `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_quota.go` & `internal/handlers/chat/gemini_handler.go` — Added `BlockAntigravityModelUntil` to cache exhausted model quotas and canonical synonyms (`gemini-3.8-flash-tiered`) in RAM until the verified reset timestamp, preventing continuous 429 spam to Google upstream while automatically unblocking the moment reset time is reached.

## [v1.8.14] — 2026-09-17

### 🐛 Upstream Parity & Bug Fixes

**Muse Spark 1.3 FreeTier Authorization & Session Normalization (PR #4105, #4061, #4062):**
- `internal/proxy/antigravity.go` — Updated Antigravity OpenCode user-agent default to `antigravity/1.18.31` and implemented descending canonical 30-character session (`ses_` + 12 hex + 14 Base62) and message (`msg_` + 12 hex + 14 Base62) ID generators. This resolves HTTP 403 `FreeTierError` when routing requests to `oc/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`.
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Added `normalizeMuseSparkResponsesBody` to strip prior multi-turn reasoning content and encrypted content blocks that trigger HTTP 400 parameter errors, while explicitly normalizing `tool_choice` to `"auto"` for Muse Spark 1.3.

**Missing `tool_call_id` FIFO Repair (PR #4090):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/tool_repair.go` & `internal/translator/request.go` — Added automatic repairing for client requests where `role: "tool"` or `function_call_output` messages omit `tool_call_id`. Uses FIFO pairing with un-paired assistant tool calls or mints deterministic call IDs to prevent strict upstreams (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Antigravity) from failing with HTTP 400.
- `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go`, & `internal/proxy/executor/transform.go` — Integrated tool call repair across OpenAI chat completions, combo routing, and account fallback handlers.

**Stream Interruption Terminal Synthesis (PR #4079):**
- `internal/proxy/sse.go` — Implemented terminal frame synthesis (`finish_reason: "network_error"` followed by `data: [DONE]\n\n`) when upstream SSE connections terminate abruptly at EOF before emitting a terminal frame, preventing IDE client hangs and errors in Cline/Pi.

**Claude Tool Result Image Hoisting (PR #4083):**
- `internal/translator/request.go` — Converted base64 image blocks embedded inside Claude `tool_result` into follow-up user messages with `[Image from tool result <id>]` and OpenAI `image_url` blocks, allowing vision models to inspect tool screenshot outputs without violating text-only tool-role schema constraints.

**Grok CLI Tool Result Neutral Placeholder (PR #4109):**
- `internal/proxy/grokcli.go` & `internal/mitm/handlers/kiro.go` — Replaced placeholder `"continue"` with neutral `"Tool results provided."` for tool-result user turns in Kiro request payloads to prevent assistant hallucination loops.

**Thinking Variant Route Stripping & Union Alpha Messages Route (PR #4084, #4099):**
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Stripped model suffix before checking `isOpencodeResponsesModel`, enabling models like `gpt-5.6-luna(high)` to correctly route to `/responses`.
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Routed Antigravity Zen `union-alpha` directly to `/zen/v1/messages` with `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`.
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` — Registered model capabilities for `union-alpha`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, and `deepseek-flash`.

## [v1.8.13] — 2026-09-16

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Parity

**Grok CLI Responses Endpoint Fix (PR #4, fixes #2):**
- `internal/providers/providers.go` — Updated `grok-cli` `BaseURL` from bare root `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com` to `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/responses`, resolving HTTP 404 HTML edge errors when calling `gcli/*` models (`grok-4.5`, `grok-4.6`).
- `internal/proxy/grokcli.go` — Added auto-normalization in `ForwardGrokCLI` so that if `cfg.BaseURL` is empty or lacks the `/v1/responses` path, it automatically normalizes to `/v1/responses`.
- `internal/handlers/chat/grokcli_handler_test.go` — Added regression tests for grok-cli BaseURL and endpoint routing.

**Custom Provider Nodes Prefix Priority & Model Mapping (PR #5, fixes #3):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go` — Prioritized custom `providerNode` prefix resolution (`h.resolvePrefixProvider(prefix, model)`) before checking built-in provider aliases (`resolveProviderAlias(prefix)`). This prevents short prefixes like `oa` or `cc` from being shadowed by `openai` or `claude`, eliminating false 502 "no active connections for provider: openai" failures when the custom node has active connections.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go` — Added fallback so that when the alias-resolved provider has no active connections, unresolved prefix queries report the matching custom `providerNode.id` instead of falsely blaming the shadowed built-in provider.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go` — Added defensive nil checks for `h.Repo` across all model and combo resolution helpers.
- `internal/db/repos.go` — Added `GetProviderNodePrefixMap()` to map internal row IDs (`openai-compatible-chat-0489...`) to user-configured prefixes (e.g. `nara`, `orca`, `oa`).
- `internal/db/repos.go` — Updated `GetCustomModels()` with fallback parsing from keys (`<providerAlias>|<modelId>|<kind>`) and removed restrictive `type == "llm"` filtering, exposing all custom chat and completion models.
- `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go` — In `HandleModels` (`GET /v1/models`) and `HandleModelLookup` (`GET /v1/models/*`), mapped `cm.ProviderAlias` through the prefix map so models are published under their clean user-configured prefix (e.g. `nara/glm-5.3`) with `owned_by` set to the prefix rather than leaking internal database row IDs.
- `internal/handlers/chat/resolution_test.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/chat_v065_test.go`, & `internal/db/repos_test.go` — Added comprehensive unit and regression tests for custom prefix priority, fallback error reporting, prefix map caching, key-fallback parsing, and `/v1/models` prefix output.

## [v1.8.12] — 2026-09-16

### 🚀 Features & Provider Additions

**Freebuff Provider Integration (`fb`):**
- `internal/proxy/executor/freebuff.go` — Added native Freebuff executor supporting `https://www.codebuff.com/api/v1/chat/completions` with 1-hour session token lifecycle caching, agent run tracking (`/api/v1/agent-runs`), Buffy system prompt marker injection, and `end_turn` tool injection for sub-agent orchestration.
- `internal/providers/providers.go` & `internal/providers/aliases.go` — Registered provider `freebuff` and alias `fb`.

**Provider Connection Routing Strategies:**
- `internal/db/settings.go` & `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go` — Added configurable multi-connection routing strategies per provider: `sticky` (with configurable `stickyLimit`), `round-robin`, `random`, and `none`.

**Model Capabilities & Limits:**
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` — Added capabilities for Upstage Solar Pro (`*solar-pro*`) and LongCat (`*longcat*`) with reasoning, tools, 200,000 token context window, and 32,000 max output tokens.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Resiliency

**Cline & Clinepass OAuth Refresh Overhaul:**
- `internal/proxy/oauth/cline.go` — Registered `clinepass` alongside `cline` in the OAuth registry, resolving issues where ClinePass connections fell back to incompatible standard form-urlencoded OAuth refresh.
- Migrated token refresh endpoint from deprecated `/v1/auth/refresh` (which returned 401 "Please make sure you're using the latest version of Cline") to active upstream `/api/v1/auth/refresh`.
- Emulated full Cline CLI identity headers on refresh (`User-Agent: Cline/3.0.61`, `X-CLIENT-TYPE: cline-cli`, `X-CLIENT-VERSION: 3.0.61`, `X-CORE-VERSION: 3.0.61`, `X-PLATFORM: cli`).
- Added token rotation support: propagated rotated `refreshToken` to SQLite database across `BuildConnectionUpdate` and `forceRefreshOAuthToken`.
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` — Ensured `refreshedKey` is normalized with `NormalizeProviderToken` on reactive 401 retries so WorkOS prefix (`workos:`) is preserved.

**Zero-Sleep Failover & Canonical Model Locking:**
- `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go` — Removed synchronous blocking sleeps (`time.Sleep`) during combo failover loops on transient errors (502, 503, 504), enabling immediate non-blocking failover to backup models/connections without stalling client turns.
- `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go` & `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go` — Added `canonicalLockModel(provider, model)` to atomically lock shared tier pools across connections (e.g., Antigravity `gemini-3.8-flash-low`/`high` map to canonical lock key `gemini-3.8-flash-tiered`). Prevents split-lock failure loops across shared tier accounts.
- `internal/providers/errorclassify.go` — Expanded error classification to trigger backoff for `resource_exhausted`, `model_capacity_exhausted`, and HTTP 502/503/504 status codes.

**Stream Telemetry & Connection Safety:**
- `internal/proxy/sse.go` — Added rolling 16-byte tail buffer in `SSECopy` to safely detect `[DONE]` across chunk boundaries and cleanly terminate SSE streams without hanging on keep-alive connections.
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` — Guaranteed `usageHistory` database logging on completed streams even when the client disconnects at stream end.
- Advertised `context_window` in `/v1/models` and `/v1/models/info` dynamically from capabilities.

## [v1.8.11] — 2026-09-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Parity — Upstream PR Porting

**Gemini Multiple System Messages Preservation (PR #3973):**
- `internal/translator/gemini.go` — Preserved all `role: "system"` messages in `req.SystemInstruction.Parts` rather than overwriting earlier instructions with the last turn, ensuring all system prompts and developer directives reach Gemini models.

**Antigravity Thinking Budget & Output Tokens Guard (PR #3981):**
- `internal/translator/gemini.go` & `internal/translator/antigravity.go` — Guarded `maxOutputTokens > thinkingBudget` across `TranslateOpenAIToGemini` and `hardenAntigravityRequest`, preventing HTTP 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT: max_tokens must be greater than thinking.budget_tokens` and erroneous connection locks on reasoning models.
- Added support for `max_completion_tokens`, `thinking.budget_tokens`, and `thinking_budget`.

**Claude Document Block Support for Antigravity & OpenAI (PR #3968):**
- `internal/translator/request.go` & `internal/translator/types.go` — Added `document` block handling in `TranslateClaudeToOpenAI` and `OpenAIFile` struct in `OpenAIContentBlock`, converting base64 PDF documents into OpenAI file format that flows into Gemini/Antigravity `inlineData`.

**Client Cancellation Tracing & Stream Telemetry:**
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` — Differentiated client cancellations (`errors.Is(fwdErr, context.Canceled)` or `ctx.Err() != nil`) from true upstream failures, logging `INF [fallback] client canceled request` and recording status `499` in traces instead of raising false `WRN upstream failed` alarms.
- `internal/handlers/chat/gemini_handler.go` — Added accurate `totalBytesWritten` accumulation for OpenAI format streaming branches and terminal `[DONE]` frame.
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` & `internal/handlers/chat/combo.go` — Refactored hardcoded HTTP status codes to standard `net/http` constants (`http.StatusOK`, `StatusClientClosedRequest`).

**Memory Leak Protections & High-Traffic Concurrency:**
- `internal/translator/usage.go` & `internal/translator/response.go` — Added `pendingFragment` struct with `createdAt` timestamps and 10-minute TTL pruning in `pruneStaleStatesLocked()`. Prevents abandoned fragmented SSE streams from accumulating in the global `pendingJSON` map.
- `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go` — Pooled and cached `*http.Client` and `*http.Transport` instances by proxy URL using `sync.RWMutex`. Eliminates per-request transport allocations, enables TCP keep-alive reuse across proxy pool traffic, and prevents socket/goroutine exhaustion.

**Live Profiling & Diagnostics:**
- `internal/handlers/router.go` — Mounted Go standard `net/http/pprof` endpoints (`/debug/pprof/`, `/debug/pprof/heap`, `/debug/pprof/goroutine`, `/debug/pprof/profile`) for real-time heap and concurrency inspection.

**Documentation & Client Guides:**
- `README.md` — Added comprehensive pre-built binary download links (macOS, Linux, Windows), one-liner install script, Docker setup, and configuration examples for Claude Code, `omp`, and Cursor/Cline.

## [v1.8.10] — 2026-09-11

### ✨ Features & Parity — Next.js v0.5.75 Sync (27 Commits)

**Gemini & Antigravity Content Normalization:**
- `internal/translator/gemini.go` & `internal/translator/antigravity.go` — Added `NormalizeGeminiContents` merging adjacent same-role messages and filtering out empty parts (parity with `#e7b5f09`).
- `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_quota.go` — Added Antigravity weekly quota tracking (`gemini_weekly`, `claude_gpt_weekly`) and free-tier handling via `retrieveUserQuotaSummary`, caching summaries and reconciling against exhausted model families (#3892).

**Kiro Routing & Wire Payload Cleanup:**
- `internal/providers/providers.go` & `internal/proxy/grokcli.go` — Routed Kiro through Amazon Q first (`https://q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/generateAssistantResponse`), deprecated legacy runtime path to avoid 400 `REQUEST_BODY_INVALID` (#3776).
- Injected `x-amz-sso-bearer`, `x-amzn-kiro-agent-mode: spec`, and `x-amzn-codewhisperer-machine-id: kiro-desktop` headers.
- `internal/proxy/grokcli.go` & `internal/mitm/handlers/kiro.go` — Stripped top-level `systemPrompt`, `agentMode`, and `conversationState` continuation fields (`agentContinuationId`, `agentTaskType`) that modern Kiro gateways reject with 400 (#1892ed7).

**Opencode-Go Catalog Refresh & Responses API:**
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Routed `grok-4.6` and `gpt-5.6-luna` on `opencode-go` to the `/zen/go/v1/responses` endpoint alongside `muse-spark`.
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` & `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Registered newly published Go models (`deepseek-flash`, `glm-5.3`, `kimi-k3`, `longcat-2.0`, `qwen3.8-max`, `qwen3.8-flash`, `hy4-preview`, `hy3`), with `deepseek-flash` (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash) priority and Qwen 3.8 models in `opencodeGoMessagesModels`.

**Codex CLI Bump & Unicode Schema Sanitization:**
- `internal/providers/providers.go` — Updated Codex CLI User-Agent to `codex_cli_rs/0.154.0` (parity with `#a7047a0`).
- `internal/proxy/executor/transform.go` — Added `StripCodexUnsupportedPatterns` to sanitize `\p{...}` / `\P{...}` Unicode property escapes in tool parameters that Codex's `/responses` validator rejects with HTTP 400 (#3922).
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` — Added Codex image models (`gpt-image-2.5`, `gpt-image-2.5-flare`, `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`, `gpt-image-2`, `gpt-image-1.5`) with `ImageOutput` capability and `*gpt-image*` pattern match.

**Claude Cache Budget & Single-Object Turns:**
- `internal/translator/request.go` — Enforced Anthropic 4-marker `cache_control` budget in `AnchorClaudeCache`: pins head anchors (last system block, last non-deferred tool) and keeps at most 2 tail message markers, trimming earlier ones (#8a81085).
- `internal/translator/request.go` — Supported single-object content turns (`content: {type: "text", ...}`) across `convertClaudeMessage`, `SanitizeClaudePassthrough`, and `AnchorClaudeCache`.
- `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go` — Scoped Claude tool type defaulting to gateways declaring `requireClaudeToolType` (MiniMax / MiniMax-CN), avoiding 400 `unknown variant custom` on DeepSeek Anthropic endpoint (#3905, #45ec1d3).

**Cline Envelope Unwrapping & Token Refresh:**
- `internal/translator/response.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/forward.go`, `internal/proxy/executor/openai.go` — Added `UnwrapClineEnvelope` unwrapping `{"success":true,"data":{...}}` for non-streaming completions on `cline` and `clinepass` (#122f23ee).
- `internal/providers/oauth.go` — Registered `clinepass` in OAuth token refresh config.
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` — Replaced `deepseek-v4-flash` with `deepseek-v4.1-flash` for `codebuddy-cn` (#807553e).

**Connection Health & Security:**
- `internal/db/accounts.go` — Added `ResetConnectionHealthState` clearing `modelLock_*`, `errorCode`, `rateLimitedUntil`, and resetting `backoffLevel = 0` upon connection activation (#3830).
- `internal/handlers/media/media.go` — Rejected path-escaping characters (`..`, `/`, `\`) in `HandleVideoGet` (#da6aa901).

**Responses API Stream & Tool Calling Fixes:**
- `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go` — Fixed tool call argument duplication (`InputValidationError` caused by duplicate concatenated JSON bodies such as `{"q":"*.yaml"}{"q":"*.yaml"}`) on Responses API streams by tracking `ArgsEmitted` during `response.function_call_arguments.delta` and suppressing redundant full argument re-emission on `response.output_item.done`.
- `internal/handlers/chat/gemini_handler.go` — Ensured terminal `data: [DONE]\n\n` SSE frame is emitted upon stream completion for OpenAI-format streaming clients and cleaned up redundant newlines.
- `internal/handlers/chat/live_e2e_test.go` — Added live non-mock E2E tests for Antigravity (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-3.8-flash-high`), DeepSeek, and OpenCode covering parallel multi-tool calls, multi-turn tool execution, streaming, and weekly quota retrieval.

## [v1.8.9] — 2026-09-06

### ✨ Features & Parity — Next.js v0.5.69 Sync (19 Commits)

**Gemini & Antigravity ThoughtSignatureStore:**
- `internal/translator/thought_signature_store.go` — Added thread-safe in-memory LRU store (capacity: 2,000 entries, 1-hour memory TTL) scoped by `sessionId` + `toolCallId`. Caches and replays thought signatures across turns to prevent corrupted thought signature errors during multi-turn reasoning conversations.
- `internal/translator/gemini.go` & `antigravity.go` — On parallel function calls, only the first call receives the signature/fallback, leaving sibling calls unsigned per Google Gemini 3+ specification.

**New Models & Capabilities Sync:**
- `internal/providers/capabilities.go` — Registered **`gpt-6-astra`** (Vision, Reasoning, Search, Tools; 272K window / 128K max output) and added `*gpt-6*` pattern match.
- Registered GPT-5.6 image aliases: `gpt-5.6-sol-image`, `gpt-5.6-terra-image`, and `gpt-5.6-luna-image` with `ImageOutput` capability.
- Qoder capabilities catalog refresh (`ultimate`, `performance`, `gmodel`, `gfmodel`, `qmodel_38max`, etc.).
- CodeBuddy-CN capabilities updated (`glm-5.2` vision enabled).

**Anti-Abuse Google Token Refresh (Antigravity):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_project.go` — Configurable `ONBOARD_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 2, down from 5) and `ONBOARD_RETRY_DELAY_MS` (default 12s) to prevent Google account rate-limit blocks during multi-account refresh (#3813).

**Anthropic-Beta Header Forwarding & Effort Normalization:**
- `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go` — Automatically injects `Anthropic-Beta: prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05, context-management-2025-06-27` for `anthropic-compatible-*` nodes serving Claude models (#3797).
- `internal/translator/request.go` & `types.go` — Normalizes Claude adaptive auto effort (`output_config.effort="auto"` and `"xhigh"` $\to$ `"high"`) (#3792).

**OpenCode-Go Executor & Responses Parallel Tool Calls Fixes:**
- `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go` — Added `deriveOpencodeSession` generating stable `x-opencode-session: ses_<32hex>` headers for all `opencode-go` requests, with fallback and client tool isolation (#3800).
- Routed `muse-spark-1.2-contributor` and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` on `opencode-go` to the `/responses` endpoint (#3819, #3820).
- `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go` — Fixed parallel tool calls argument collision on Responses API SSE stream by indexing events via `item_id`. Emits arguments from `response.output_item.done` when upstreams send arguments on item completion without deltas.
- `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go` — Fixed `handleCodexStream` SSE stream truncation and disconnects on `muse-spark-1.3` (and 1.2) by switching to `proxy.ScanStream` (up to 10MB buffered scanner), preventing line fragmentation when handling large (>3KB) encrypted reasoning payloads across TCP packet boundaries.
- `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go` — Added support for `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta`, `response.reasoning_text.delta`, and `response.thought.delta` emitting `reasoning_content` delta chunks for thinking models.
- `internal/proxy/sse.go` — Added `HeartbeatWriter` emitting periodic `: keep-alive\n\n` comments every 15 seconds during prolonged upstream reasoning phases (fixes #3796 stream stall timeouts on strict clients like Oh My Pi during deep thinking on `ag/gemini-3.8-flash*`).
- `internal/proxy/stall.go` — Added `NewStallReaderWithContext` binding client `ctx.Done()` directly to body closer, immediately freeing upstream sockets on client abort and eliminating Windows socket leaks (`CLOSE_WAIT`/`FIN_WAIT_1`).
**Database Path Configuration:**
- `internal/config/config.go` — Enhanced `DB_PATH` resolution to automatically detect `db/data.sqlite`, `data.sqlite`, or `9router.db` when pointed directly to a directory (e.g. `E:\project\database\9router`).
## [v1.8.8] — 2026-09-03

### ✨ E2E & Parity — Next.js v0.5.65 (31 commits)

**E2E Gemini 3.8 Flash High + tool calling (deterministic mocks):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/gemini38_e2e_test.go` — `gemini-3.8-flash-high` via Antigravity `2.11.0` non-stream + multi-turn + stream SSE `get_weather_ide` uncloaking, `prefixItems` cleaning, `thoughtSignature` backfill, `tool_calls` dedup. Ports `decolua/9router` `gemini-3.8-flash-medium/high/low` + `capabilities.go:*gemini-3.8*` + `antigravity.go:gemini-3.8-flash-tiered` + `proxy/gemini.go:2.11.0`.

**E2E Opencode muse-spark (deterministic mocks, no real network):**
- `internal/handlers/chat/opencode_mock_e2e_test.go` — `oc/muse-spark-1.2` & `1.3` via `Responses API /v1/responses` SSE `output_item.added` + `function_call_arguments.delta/done` aggregation, `reasoning max→xhigh`, `Vision:true` (`capabilities.go:124` pattern `*muse-spark*`), `image_url` preservation. Fixes routing `muse-spark-1.3` `500` → `200` (`providers.go:293` `Contains(muse-spark)` + `capabilities.go:124` `1.3`).

**Unit tests — now locking logic (previously untested):**
- `providers_v065_test.go` — `claude-cli/2.1.258` + full `Anthropic-Beta`, `ollama FetchURL https://ollama.com/api/web_fetch`, `gemini-3.8` caps, `muse-spark 1.2/1.3`, `codebuddy-cn hy3/hy3-x/hy4-preview/x/glm-5.3/kimi-k3-1` + EOL `glm-5.0/4.7` removed, `GetModelTokenLimits` 3.8.
- `translator/claude_cache_test.go` — `LastCacheableToolIndex` + `AnchorClaudeCache` for `defer_loading:true` tail, all-deferred, stripping client `cache_control` (#3567).
- `handlerutil/ssrf_test.go` — `trailing dot` (`localhost.`), `CGNAT 100.64/10`, `169.254.169.254`, IPv6 `::ffff:7f00:1` hex, `64:ff9b::`, `fe80/fc`, `normalizeHost`, `parseIPv6ToGroups`.
- `mitm/handlers/mitm_handlers_test.go` — `HandleKiro` removes `systemPrompt` + `userInputMessage.images → image_url data:`, `HandleAntigravity` preserves `fetchAvailableModels(2.11.0)` vs overrides `generateContent→1.23.2`.
- `usagetracker/quota_parsers_test.go` `TestParseGroqQuotasFromHeaders` — `x-ratelimit-*` Go duration `2m59.56s` → `requests/tokens` `used/total/resetAt`.
- `handlers/chat/chat_v065_test.go` — `HandleModelLookup` kind `image` + `cc/claude-sonnet-4-6` + encoded slash + 404 `model_not_found`, `HandleModels` custom `cc/my-custom-vision` caps, `StrikeReassert` 3×429 optimistic 90% → `CACHE_BLOCK 15m` + re-assert after `Refresh`.
- `proxy/executor/opencode_test.go` `MuseSpark13_ResponsesRouting` + `OCPrefix` — routing `1.3` + `oc/` to `/responses`.

**Fixes:**
- **Opencode 1.3 `500` → `200`** — `ForwardOpencode` routing `Contains(muse-spark)` + `capabilities` `1.3` Vision (fixes report `14:11:47` `muse-spark-1.3 500`).
- **jcode tool_smoke 3→1** — `stream.go:118` dedup `ToolCallIdx` + `codebuddy.go:168` `sseToOpenAIJSON` dedup `arguments` for `bash` `intent` split (fixes `echo JCODE_TOOL_OK` 3 tool_calls).
- **Flaky real upstream 429** — `muse_spark_e2e_test.go` real `opencode.ai` `429 FreeUsageLimitError` now `Skip` instead of `Fail`.
- **DB flaky `429` in `go test ./...`** — `go vet` clean, `ps` `9router-go 20130` health `{"status":"ok"}` (not stopped, log stopped due to `user stepped away` recap 98k prompt).

## [v1.8.7] — 2026-09-02

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Gemini `system_instruction` Empty Part 400 Fix** — `StripCompetitivePrompts` now drops empty `system_instruction` parts after `rewriteCompetingBranding` (e.g. `"You are a Claude agent..."` -> `""`) and filters empty text parts in `contents`; if all parts are empty the `system_instruction` is removed (`nil`) instead of emitting `{"parts":[{}]}` which Gemini rejects as `system_instruction.parts[0].data: required oneof field 'data' must have one initialized field`. Also `TranslateOpenAIToGemini` now `TrimSpace` checks system content. Fixes `ForwardGemini (antigravity/gemini-3.7-flash-high): ...system_instruction.parts[0].data: required oneof`. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`, `internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Gemini Tool Schema `required` Inside `properties` 400 Fix** — `cleanGeminiSchema` now detects misplaced `required` array inside `properties` (e.g. `{"properties":{"query":{...},"required":["query"]}}`) and promotes it to top-level `required`, fixing `Invalid value at 'request.tools[0].function_declarations[0].parameters.properties[0].value' (Map), Cannot have repeated items ('required') within a map. Unknown name ""`. This was the root cause of the `12:14:50` `query_db_ide` 400 after the `where.items` fix. Also sanitizes all OpenAI-compatible providers (including `opencode`) via `fallback.go` `SanitizeOpenAITools`. (`internal/translator/schema.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go`)
- **Opencode `muse-spark` Tool Name Triplication Fix** — `sseToOpenAIJSON` `internal/proxy/executor/codebuddy.go:168` now only sets `name` if empty and avoids duplicating `arguments` already sent via `delta`/`done`; `ProcessCodexEvent` `stream.go:148` for `response.function_call_arguments.delta/done` now deduplicates `name` and tracks `ToolCallArgs` to prevent `get_weather` -> `get_weatherget_weatherget_weather` and `{"location":"Jakarta"}{"location":"Jakarta"}` on `combo-wombo` (`oc/muse-spark-1.2`) non-stream and stream. (`internal/proxy/executor/codebuddy.go`, `internal/proxy/executor/stream.go`)

## [v1.8.6] — 2026-09-02

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Gemini Tool Schema `where.items.items: missing field` 400 Fix** — `cleanGeminiSchema` now ensures every `type: array` has a valid `items` schema (default `{"type":"string"}`), flattens `prefixItems` (2020-12 tuple) and `items: [...]` tuple to single `items`, and auto-fills inner `items` without `type`/`properties`/`enum`. Fixes `ForwardGemini (antigravity/gemini-3.7-flash-high): upstream returned 400: ...where.items.items: missing field.` when Claude Code sends DB-like tools with nested `array<array>` params. Added `internal/proxy/gemini.go` 400 payload dump to `/tmp/9router-gemini-400.json` for post-mortem. (`internal/translator/schema.go`, `internal/proxy/gemini.go`)
- **Bare Alias `ag` -> `antigravity` Resolution** — `resolveModel("ag")` now checks `ProviderAliasMap` before common-provider fallback, so `POST /search` with `{"model":"ag"}` correctly routes to `antigravity` instead of `deepseek/ag` -> `404 Via cloudfront`. Parity with Next.js `ag` search. (`internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`)
- **Antigravity Search Default Model Parity** — `handleAntigravitySearch` default changed `gemini-3-flash-agent` -> `gemini-2.5-flash` (Next.js `ag` search returns `answer.model: gemini-2.5-flash`), fixing `500 UNKNOWN` from `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` for bare `ag` search. (`internal/handlers/media/antigravity_search.go`)
- **Claude `call_` Tool Name Fallback Fix (Gateway IP Check)** — `TranslateOpenAIToClaude` no longer falls back to `tc.ID` (`call_...`) when `Function.Name` is empty; skips invalid tool calls instead of emitting `tool_use` with `name: call_...` which caused `No such tool available: call_...` and `Invalid tool parameters` churn on `toloing cek config gateway` via `opencode/muse-spark`. (`internal/translator/response.go:165`, `cf42120`, port `decolua/9router#2077`/`#3685`)
- **Claude Streaming Tool Delta Deduplication** — `TranslateOpenAIToClaudeStreamSession` now checks `state.ToolCalls[idx]` before creating a new `content_block_start`; second delta for same `idx`/`id` (Codex `output_item.added` + `function_call_arguments.delta` same `call_...`) no longer creates duplicate `tool_use` and empty `partial_json: "{}"`; correctly buffers `arguments` and emits `{"command":"ip route ..."}`. Fixes `InputValidationError: Bash missing command` on `Gue cek gateway IP...` streaming. (`internal/translator/response.go:468`, `ea10c16`)
- **Bash Extra Fields Strip** — `sanitizeBashArgs` now keeps only `command`, deletes hallucinated `description` etc. inside `input` (`{"command":"ls ...","description":"List home..."}` -> `{"command":"ls ..."}`), fixing `Bash(input JSON failed to parse — 433 bytes)` on `Cek gateway config — lagi intip file-file di home`. (`internal/translator/sanitize.go:239`, `6b94535`)
- **Server Tool Use Foreign ID Drop (Combo Poison)** — `SanitizeClaudePassthrough` drops `server_tool_use` with id not matching `^srvtoolu_` (e.g. `call_` from `z.ai/glm` `analyze_image`) and paired `tool_result`, strips empty text and empty messages. Port `decolua/9router#3686`. (`internal/translator/request.go:342`, `cf42120`)
- **1M Context Marker Strip** — `stripModelContextMarker` strips trailing `[1m]`/`[1M]` from `claude-opus-5[1m]` before `resolveModel`, so combo `combo-wombo[1m]` routes correctly instead of `Invalid model format`. Port `decolua/9router#3691`. (`internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go:135`)
- **Streaming Model Echo** — `SeedStreamState` pre-seeds `StreamState.Model` with client-requested model via `WithRequestedModel` context so `message_start` echoes `combo-wombo` not `claude-3-5-sonnet` provider model. Port `decolua/9router#3693`. (`internal/translator/usage.go:41`, `forward.go:91`)
- **GPT-5 / o-series `max_completion_tokens`** — `requiresMaxCompletionTokens` (`/gpt-5|o[134]-/i`) emits `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` for `gpt-5`/`o1-`/`o3-`/`o4-` in `TranslateClaudeToOpenAI`. Port `decolua/9router#3657`. (`internal/translator/request.go:12`, `types.go:202`)
- **Antigravity Optimistic Quota Strike-Breaker** — after 3 consecutive `429` for same `connection|model` within 60s while quota `remaining>0`, `HandleAntigravityQuotaError` returns `CACHE_BLOCK 15m` instead of looping 300s `modelLock`. Port `decolua/9router#3684`. (`internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_quota.go:44`)
- **Forced-SSE JSON for Claude Clients** — `handleJSONResponse` detects `isSSEBody` when `translate=true` and `stream:false` retry hits forced-stream provider (Responses-API), aggregates via `sseToClaudeJSON` then `TranslateOpenAIToClaude` to return `Anthropic Message` not `chat.completion`. Port `decolua/9router#3683`. (`internal/handlers/chat/forward.go:144`)
- **OpenRouter Pattern Compat + Combo Tools Detection** — `NormalizeToolSchemasForProvider("openrouter")` strips invalid `pattern` regex (keep valid, handle `properties` named `properties`), and `DetectRequiredCapabilities` now requires `tools` capability for `type:function`/`functionDeclarations`. Port `decolua/9router#3665`. (`internal/translator/tool_schema.go`, `combo.go:129`, `forward.go:35`)

## [v1.8.5] — 2026-08-31

### ✨ Features & Parity (Next.js v0.5.59 Sync)

- **New Search Providers & Credential Fallback** — added `xquik` (X search provider with raw API key), `ollama-search`, and `zai-search` (GLM Coding web search). Added automatic credential fallback where search providers borrow API keys from parent chat connections (`ollama` / `glm`) when dedicated search connections are absent. (`internal/providers/providers.go`, `internal/providers/aliases.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go`)
- **Antigravity Web Search Provider** — added Antigravity as a web search provider via Google Search grounding, with full Next.js parity for the search response structure. (`internal/handlers/media/antigravity_search.go`)
- **New Models & Capabilities Sync** — registered new flagship models: `GLM-5.3-Flash` (1M context window + native vision multimodal), `GLM-5.3`, `DeepSeek V4 Vision`, `Grok 4.5/4.6` (500k context window), and `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`. (`internal/providers/capabilities.go`, `internal/providers/aliases.go`)
- **Claude Tool Type Defaulting (`type: "custom"`)** — added `DefaultClaudeToolType` ensuring tools in Claude-format requests always carry a valid `type` (defaulting to `"custom"` when omitted), preventing HTTP 400 rejection on strict Anthropic-compatible gateways such as MiniMax. (`internal/translator/request.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/chat.go`)
- **Claude Code Session ID Header Support** — prioritized `x-claude-code-session-id` in `ExtractSessionID` to ensure stable prompt caching and avoid conversation fragmentation across client tool calls. (`internal/handlerutil/response.go`)
- **CommandCode In-Stream Error Peeking** — peeks the initial NDJSON event in CommandCode stream for `type: "error"` before committing HTTP 200 OK headers, transforming internal stream errors into real HTTP error statuses (429, 503, 401, etc.) so combo and account fallback trigger seamlessly. (`internal/proxy/executor/stream.go`)
- **OpenCode Responses API Parity (v0.5.59)** — completed Responses API translation for OpenCode Muse Spark: proper tool names emitted on `response.output_item.added`, accurate usage and prompt-cache token extraction from `response.completed`, Claude SSE streaming translation and non-streaming support in `handleCodexStream`, and 64-char clamping for `call_id`. (`internal/proxy/executor/`)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Gemini Cached Token Extraction** — added support for both `cachedContentTokenCount` and `cachedContentToken` keys in Gemini stream and non-stream responses. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Non-Interactive Test Execution** — bypassed interactive `sudo security` CA keychain install when executing unit tests, ensuring fast, deterministic test suite completion. (`internal/mitm/cert.go`)
- **Self-Update SHA256 Verification** — `PerformSelfUpdate` now downloads to memory, verifies the expected SHA-256 checksum, and refuses to install mismatched binaries, eliminating the risk of installing corrupted or tampered updates. (`internal/updater/updater.go`)
- **Graceful Self-Restart** — replaced abrupt `os.Exit` after self-update with `syscall.Kill(SIGTERM)` plus a graceful fallback, giving in-flight requests and DB connections a chance to drain cleanly. (`internal/updater/updater.go`)
- **Cross-Platform Restart** — extracted the self-signal into a platform-specific `signalSelfShutdown` helper (`signal_unix.go` sends SIGTERM; `signal_windows.go` is a no-op that falls back to `os.Exit(0)`), fixing the Windows cross-compile of the release binaries. (`internal/updater/signal_unix.go`, `internal/updater/signal_windows.go`)
- **Smart Archive Executable Selection** — `extractExecutableBytes` now scores archive entries (penalizing README/LICENSE/`*.md`/`*.sha256`) and validates ELF/Mach-O/PE magic bytes, reliably picking the real binary from multi-file release archives. (`internal/updater/updater.go`)
- **SSE Copy Race Condition** — replaced the shared pooled buffer in `SSECopy` with a per-call local buffer, eliminating concurrent read/write races on the pool buffer. (`internal/proxy/sse.go`)
- **Nil Guard in Token-Saving Compression** — guarded against a nil `rawMap` when the upstream body cannot be decoded, preventing a panic on malformed responses. (`internal/tokensaver/compress.go`)
- **Quota Percentage Clamping** — clamped `RemainingPercentage` to a sane `[0, 100]` range so upstream values >100 or negative cannot skew quota-block and dashboard logic. (`internal/usagetracker/quota_parsers.go`)
- **Exponential Backoff for Antigravity Onboarding** — replaced the fixed 2s sleep between `onboardUser` retries with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, ...) that also honors context cancellation, so a 429 burst no longer gets hammered by fixed-interval retries. (`internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_project.go`)
- **Decloak Deduplication** — extracted a shared `decloakContentBlockStart` helper used by both `DecloakStreamChunk` and `DecloakClaudeStreamEvent`, removing duplicate content-block-start logic. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`)
- **Tool Property Sanitization** — preserved tool parameters named after reserved keywords and sanitized `required` fields against the declared `properties`, preventing schema validation failures. (`internal/translator/sanitize.go`)

## [v1.8.4] — 2026-08-14

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Resilience

- **Combo Cycle Graceful Recovery & Fault Tolerance** — `flattenComboModels` now gracefully skips recursive / self-referencing combo branches with a warning log instead of failing hard with HTTP 400 (`combo cycle detected`), ensuring chatbot requests continue executing remaining valid models seamlessly. (`internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`)
- **Safe Model Resolution on Leaf Models** — eliminates potential slice index-out-of-range edge cases when resolving combo leaf models that do not contain a provider prefix. (`internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`)
- **Multi-Level Nested Combo Support** — verified recursive cascading combo expansion (e.g. `super-combo` → `mid-combo` → `base-combo` → leaf models) so all reachable models participate in round-robin, sticky, and fallback strategies. (`internal/handlers/chat/resolution.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/resolution_test.go`)

## [v1.8.3] — 2026-08-14

### ✨ Features

- **Antigravity Gemini 3.7 Flash Model Mapping** — canonical model IDs and aliases for `gemini-3.7-flash`, `gemini-3.7-flash-high`, `gemini-3.7-flash-agent`, `gemini-3.7-flash-medium`, `gemini-3.7-flash-low`, `gemini-3.7-flash-extra-low`, and `gemini-3.7-flash-thinking` correctly mapped to Google Antigravity backend model IDs (`gemini-3-flash-agent` / `gemini-3.5-flash-low`), fixing upstream 404 errors. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`)
- **Enriched Prompt-Injection Guard** — enhanced prompt-injection detector with heuristic patterns for raw model delimiters (`<|im_start|>system`, `<<SYS>>`, `[SYSTEM PROMPT]`, `[INST]`), verbatim system prompt extraction attempts, and developer/admin mode override simulations. (`internal/tokensaver/injection.go`)
- **Accurate Gemini Cached Token Tracking** — correctly unmarshals and propagates `cachedContentTokenCount` from Gemini stream and non-stream responses into `OpenAIUsage.CachedTokens`, providing accurate cache hit reporting and cost calculation. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Gemini Vision FileData & Audio Modalities** — added support for remote HTTP/HTTPS image URLs (`fileData: { fileUri, mimeType: "image/*" }`), base64 input audio (`input_audio`, `audio_url`), and uploaded documents in Gemini native translator, matching Next.js full multimodal capabilities. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Realtime SSE Usage Stream & Topology Animation** — added in-memory in-flight request tracker (`internal/usagetracker`), real-time SSE broadcasting (`GET /api/usage/stream` and `GET /usage/stream`), and recent requests ring buffer matching the Next.js dashboard shape, enabling instant glowing pulse node & marching-ants edge animations on the Usage Topology graph when requests are handled by `9router-go`. (`internal/usagetracker/tracker.go`, `internal/handlers/usage_stream.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/usage.go`)
- **Antigravity Anti-Competitive Prompt Stripping & 429 Prevention** — automatically strips competitor identity phrases (e.g. `"You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK."` from Zed IDE and Claude agents) from `system_instruction` and message contents, preventing Antigravity from returning synthetic `429 Quota Exhausted` errors. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`)
- **Edge Relay URL Rewriting & Header Forwarding** — automatically rewrites `BaseURL` to the relay deployment and injects `x-relay-target` and `x-relay-path` headers when a connection uses a Vercel, Cloudflare Worker, or Deno Edge Relay Proxy Pool. (`internal/handlers/chat/connections.go`)
- **No-Auth Provider Proxy Pool Strategy** — automatically respects `settings.providerStrategies` for no-auth providers (e.g. `mimo-free`, `opencode`), attaching configured proxy pools or rotation strategies to virtual connections. (`internal/handlers/chat/connections.go`, `internal/db/settings.go`)
- **Snake_case Model Limits on `/v1/models` & `/v1/models/info`** — exposes `context_length`, `max_completion_tokens`, `max_input_tokens`, and `max_output_tokens` so clients like Cline, Roo Code, and LibreChat resolve proper context ceilings. (`internal/handlers/chat/chat.go`, `internal/providers/capabilities.go`)
- **CodeBuddy OAuth Configuration** — registered `codebuddy-cn` and `codebuddy-intl` OAuth token refresh configurations. (`internal/providers/oauth.go`)
- **OpenCode Official Client Fingerprint Headers** — injects official headers (`User-Agent: opencode`, `x-opencode-client: desktop`, `x-opencode-session: ses_...`, `x-opencode-request: msg_...`, `x-opencode-project: global`) on free-tier OpenCode requests to prevent rate limiting from unidentified client traffic. (`internal/proxy/opencode.go`, `internal/proxy/executor/providers.go`)
- **Kimchi Dual Authentication** — supports direct API keys (`Authorization: Bearer <key>`) in addition to OAuth tokens with seamless credential resolution. (`internal/handlers/chat/connections.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/kimchi_handler_test.go`)
- **Startup Banner & Version Display** — dynamically displays current version in CLI startup banner (`🚀 9Router Go Proxy (v1.8.3) on :20130`) and server ready logs. (`cmd/9router-go/main.go`)
- **New Provider Registries & Aliases** — added Alibaba Token Plan Singapore (`alitp-intl` / `ali-tp` / `alitp`) and Fish Audio Text-to-Speech (`fish-audio` / `fish`). (`internal/providers/providers.go`, `internal/providers/aliases.go`)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Invalid Tool Parameters & Decoy Schemas** — provided valid non-empty `properties.reason` schema for all 21 Antigravity decoy tools and mapped `tool_call_id` to exact function names in OpenAI-to-Gemini conversation history, eliminating protobuf validation errors when using Claude Code or other tool-calling clients. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`, `internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Antigravity Upstream Model Resolution** — prevented invalid model aliases like `gemini-3.7-flash-high` from reaching Google Cloud Code without being translated to their backend model IDs. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`)

### 📚 Documentation

- Comprehensive refresh of `README.md`, `COMPARISON.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` (0 open items), and newly added `ROADMAP.md`.

## [v1.8.2] — 2026-08-14

### ✨ Features

- **Antigravity Tool Cloaking & Anti-Ban Decoy System** — automatically cloaks client tool declarations with `_ide` suffixes (e.g. `Bash_ide`), injects 21 official Antigravity IDE decoy tools (`run_command`, `replace_file_content`, `grep_search`, `list_dir`, etc.), synchronizes conversation history functionCall/functionResponse names, and seamlessly uncloaks tool names on response SSE stream and non-stream outputs. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`, `internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Antigravity Native Image Generation** — added image model detection (`imagen`, `*image*`), aspect ratio suffix parsing (`16x9`, `4:3`, `1:1`, custom resolutions via GCD reduction), `requestType: "image_gen"` envelope wrapping with forced non-streaming `/v1internal:generateContent`, and OpenAI-compatible base64 image response formatting. (`internal/translator/antigravity.go`, `internal/proxy/gemini.go`)
- **Edge Relay & Transport Engine** — added transport support for Vercel, Cloudflare Worker, and Deno edge relays using `x-relay-target` and `x-relay-path` headers, wildcard `noProxy` domain filtering, and legacy connection-level proxy configuration fallback (`connectionProxyUrl`). (`internal/proxy/transport.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/connections.go`)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Proxy Pool DB Parsing Bug** — fixed `GetProxyPool` (`internal/db/proxyPools.go`) failing to parse single string `proxyUrl` created by Next.js UI / `InsertProxyPool`, which previously caused proxy pools to be silently ignored and requests to fall back to direct connections. Added parsing for `type`, `noProxy`, and `strictProxy` metadata.

## [v1.8.1] — 2026-08-12

### ✨ Features

- **Combo strategy sync with Next.js reference** — per-combo rotation state, correct auto-switch ordering, and a capabilities provider (`internal/providers/capabilities.go`) replacing the hardcoded vision/pdf maps with tiered capability detection.
- **Flatten nested combos** — `combo-wombo → free-tier` now expands to its four leaf models, so round-robin actually rotates across them instead of always landing on the first leaf (this was hammering one account and producing the `429 all connections for this provider are rate-limited` error).
- **Turn-aware rotation** — `applyComboStrategy` advances the rotation index only on a new turn; mid-turn tool-use requests reuse the model serving the turn, so the provider never switches mid-turn (which broke Gemini thinking models that require a `thought_signature` on current-turn function calls).
- **Bounded retry-once on total combo 429** — when every combo model fails with a Retry-After ≤ 8s, the pass waits once and retries before surfacing a hard 429 (`comboRetryAfter`).
- **Backfill default `thought_signature`** — every `functionCall` part now carries a `thoughtSignature` (the real one via `__ts__` transport when present, else the Next.js `DEFAULT_THINKING_AG_SIGNATURE`), closing the last 400-`thought_signature` gaps on mixed combos.
- **Gemini tool-schema keyword parity** — strip the remaining unsupported JSON-Schema keywords (`multipleOf`, `uniqueItems`, `contains`, `unevaluated*`, `contentSchema`) and fill bare `{}` schemas with the object placeholder, matching Next.js `cleanJSONSchemaForAntigravity` (fixes `Invalid tool parameters` 400 from antigravity).
- **Sanitize tools on the OpenAI-compat Gemini path** — the `gemini` provider is now marked `gemini-openai` and its `/v1beta/openai` bodies are run through `SanitizeOpenAITools`, so the strict schema validation applies on both Gemini routes.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Emit camelCase `thoughtSignature`** — the Gemini-native `generateContent` endpoint only recognizes the camelCase part field; the snake_case regression caused the `400 Function call is missing a thought_signature` error. Both read and write directions now handle camelCase.
- **Use the daily antigravity endpoint** — migrate `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` → `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` for the `antigravity` provider (`providers.go`, `antigravity_project.go`, MITM domain list) to avoid strict rate limits.
- **Combo connection retry-loop parity** — connection retry loop now matches the single-model path.

### 🧹 Chores / Docs

- Remove the stray `patch_combo.go` throwaway script.
- Add design specs and implementation plans for the combo sync / thought_signature / backfill / schema-parity work.

## [v1.8.0] — 2026-08-11

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Combo/router fallback bypasses model-lock backoff on retryable errors → antigravity rate-limit loop** — `handleComboFallback` / `handleMessagesComboFallback` (`internal/handlers/chat/combo.go`) called `tryForwardWithConnection` directly, so `LockConnectionModel` was never invoked on retryable errors (429/500s) — unlike the single-model path `handleAccountFallback`. The exponential 429 backoff was dead in the router path: every request re-tried all combo models back-to-back on the same connection/account, got 429, returned 429, and the client's ~35s retry repeated the loop forever. Fix:
  - New `comboLockRetryable` helper runs on every `RetryableStatusCodes` error in both combo loops — classifies via `ClassifyError`, calls `LockConnectionModel(connID, model, cooldownSec, newBackoffLevel)` so the exponential backoff persists across requests, and appends the conn to a request-local `excludeIDs` passed into `getBestConnection` so remaining combo models don't re-select the same connection (same account = same quota bucket).
  - A locked-connection skip covers pinned connections whose direct-fetch branch bypasses `getBestConnection`'s lock check.
  - `context.Background()` → `ctx` in `handleComboFallback` so client cancels propagate; the 502/503/504 transient-wait sleep is preserved.
  - Test: `TestHandleMessagesComboFallback_429LocksAndExcludesConnection` asserts a 429 locks the connection AND keeps the second combo model from re-hitting it (exactly 1 upstream hit).

## [v1.7.2] — 2026-08-08

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Antigravity 429/404 failure-loop fix** — An unprovisioned Antigravity account
  (`onboardUser` returns `200` with an empty `cloudaicompanionProject`) left the
  connection without a `projectID`. The router then force-refreshed the OAuth
  token on every request (never an auth problem, so it never helped), fell through
  to a guaranteed-404 OpenAI-compatible lane on `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`,
  and repeated client retries rammed Google's rate limit (`429`). (`internal/handlers/chat/gemini_handler.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_project.go`)
  - `fetchAntigravityProjectID` now reports the outcome (`projectID`, `authFailed`,
    `noProject`). Token refresh runs **only** on a genuine `401/403` — never on a
    missing/empty project.
  - When antigravity has no project ID, it no longer burns a request on the dead
    OpenAI lane; it returns an error and the fallback chain moves straight to the
    next provider.
  - **Negative cache (10 min, per connection):** once Google confirms "no project",
    later requests skip the `loadCodeAssist`/`onboardUser` RPCs entirely — this is
    what stops the repeated `429` hammering.
  - Onboarding guidance is logged once per connection per window
    ("onboard the account via Antigravity IDE/CLI, then re-login"); repeated
    failures log at `Debug` instead of spamming `Warn`. (`internal/handlers/chat/fallback.go`)

### 🧪 Tests

- `antigravity_project_test.go` — pins the probe classification (project found /
  token rejected `401`+`403` / project definitively missing / transient `429`+`503`)
  and the negative-cache expiry semantics. (`internal/handlers/chat/antigravity_project_test.go`)

## [v1.7.1] — 2026-08-08

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Cached-token parity across every provider** — Prompt-cache accounting no longer works only for antigravity. Gemini `usageMetadata.cachedContentToken` now flows through both non-stream and stream translation into OpenAI `usage.cached_tokens`; the `!translate` response path uses a dual-format parser (`ParseResponseUsage`) that reads Claude `cache_read_input_tokens`/`cache_creation_input_tokens` and OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, so cached tokens survive any provider → OpenAI → Claude double translation. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`, `internal/translator/response.go`)
- **Gemini tool-schema `const` re-injection** — `stripUnsupported` now re-runs after `anyOf`/`oneOf` flattening so `const` and vendor `x-*` keys can't leak back into the merged branch. (`internal/translator/schema.go`)
- **Provider 403 is now retryable** — Gemini/antigravity daily-quota errors can arrive as HTTP 403; these now trigger the connection fallback instead of a hard failure. (`internal/providers/providers.go`)
- **CodeBuddy CN stream cleanup** — The stall reader is now closed after the stream, stopping its shutdown watcher + stall timer (no per-request goroutine leak). (`internal/proxy/executor/codebuddy.go`)

### ⚙️ Graceful Shutdown Hardening

- New `internal/shutdown` package: a process-wide signal the first Ctrl+C / SIGTERM fires.
- `StallReader` now closes in-flight SSE upstream bodies on shutdown, so `server.Shutdown` drains streams in milliseconds instead of waiting out the 15s deadline — and the deferred DB/log-file close always runs.
- Translate-path SSE handlers emit a final `data: [DONE]` on abort so clients get a clean end instead of a truncated stream.
- A second Ctrl+C / SIGTERM force-quits immediately (stuck-drain escape hatch).
- Shutdown timeout logs a warning instead of `log.Fatalf`, so `conn.Close()` and the log file are still closed gracefully. (`internal/proxy/stall.go`, `cmd/9router-go/main.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/forward.go`, `internal/proxy/executor/openai.go`)

### 🔧 Internal

- Stream handlers now carry the request `ctx` and pull accumulated usage (incl. cached tokens) out of the translation session, so logged usage reflects real token counts instead of the character-estimate fallback.

## [v1.7.0] — 2026-08-06

### 🚀 New Executors

- **Trae SOLO remote agent** (`internal/proxy/executor/trae.go`) — Port of `open-sse/executors/trae.js`: `POST {base}/chat_sessions` creates a session, `GET {base}/chat_sessions/{id}/events` streams `plan_item` / `token_usage` / `done` as SSE. Cumulative `plan_item.thought` rendering (longest-wins per id, delta-only emission), `Cloud-IDE-JWT` auth, and `work`/`auto`/manual model modes. Non-stream requests aggregate into a single `chat.completion`. Round-trip test: `TestForwardTrae_StreamsAccumulatedThought`.
- **Windsurf gRPC-web** (`internal/proxy/executor/windsurf.go`) — Port of `open-sse/executors/windsurf.js`: hand-rolled protobuf `GetChatMessageRequest` encoder (Metadata.api_key + cascade_id + model_or_alias + repeated messages), gRPC-web framing (0x00 flag + big-endian length), and a `CompletionChunk` decoder (content / done+UsageStats / error) streaming OpenAI SSE. Catalog→wire model alias map ported verbatim; `crypto/rand` session/cascade ids. Non-stream requests aggregate frames into `chat.completion`. Round-trip test: `TestForwardWindsurf_StreamsGRPCWeb`.

### 🎙️ Xiaomi MiMo TTS

- `/v1/audio/speech` for the `xiaomi-mimo` provider now uses the chat-completions contract (port of `open-sse/handlers/ttsProviders/xiaomi-mimo.js`): target text in `role:assistant`, style/language instructions in `role:user`, voice via top-level `audio.voice`, base64 audio from `choices[0].message.audio.data`. (`internal/handlers/media/media.go`)

### ➕ Providers

- **tokenrouter** — Registered as an OpenAI-compatible upstream (`https://api.tokenrouter.com/v1/chat/completions`).

### 🗑️ Removed

- **qwen provider** — Removed from providers, OAuth config, and the alias map (deprecated upstream).

### 📋 Docs

- `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` — windsurf + trae moved to resolved; zed + devin-cli documented with the safe-stopgap note (devin-cli corrected: ACP over **stdio** subprocess, not HTTP).

## [v1.6.1] — 2026-08-05

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CodeBuddy CN 502** (`internal/proxy/executor/codebuddy.go`) — `codebuddy-cn` / `codebuddy-intl` now use a dedicated executor that forces `stream=true` upstream (CodeBuddy rejects non-stream with HTTP 400 code 11101), injects the CLI/IDE static headers, and re-aggregates OpenAI-chat SSE into a single `chat.completion` for non-stream clients (`sseToOpenAIJSON`, mirroring JS `parseSSEToOpenAIResponse`).
- Provider parity with the reference implementation.

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-08-04

### 🚀 Next.js Engine Feature Ports

- **TTS Voice Listing** (`/audio/voices`) — Full voice-listing with provider support (`edge-tts` default, `elevenlabs`, `gemini`, `local-device`), `?lang` filter, 24h in-process cache, and `byLang`/`languages` grouping matching the dashboard's media-providers page.
- **Proxy-Pools Deploy** (`/proxy-pools/{vercel,deno,cloudflare}-deploy`) — Deploy edge relay functions to Vercel/Deno/Cloudflare with status polling, plus a new `InsertProxyPool` DB method writing byte-compatible `data` JSON.
- **Headroom Management** (`/headroom/*`) — Full headroom-ai lifecycle in Go: binary/Python detection, spawn/stop/restart, compression extras install/uninstall, `/headroom/proxy` reverse proxy with SSRF guard, and dashboard HTML rewrite.
- **CLI-Tools Status** (`/cli-tools/all-statuses`) — Batch detection of 14 CLI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, etc.) installed state + version.
- **Live Console Logs** (`/translator/console-logs`, `/stream`) — In-process ring buffer + SSE streaming of engine log output so the dashboard's "Monitor Console Log" shows Go logs live (25s keepalive, init/line/clear events).

### 🔍 Observability

- **Lightweight Request Tracing** (`/debug/traces`) — In-memory span recording + p50/p95/p99 latency per provider+model with `?n=` cap. Stdlib-only, no OpenTelemetry SDK dependency.

### 🛡️ Security

- **Prompt-Injection Guard** — Heuristic detection (`messages[]`, `input[]`, Claude content blocks) tagging classic injection attempts in logs. Toggle via `--no-injection-guard` / `INJECTION_GUARD_DISABLED` (on by default).
- **`/admin/health/reset` Moved Behind API-Key Auth** — Previously public; now requires a valid API key to prevent unauthenticated health-state resets (open-source hardening).
- **MITM Binds Loopback Only** — TLS proxy binds `127.0.0.1:443` instead of all interfaces, preventing LAN clients from using it as an open proxy.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Stability

- **SSE Fragment Rejoin** — Fixed `unexpected end of JSON input` on opencode free-tier by buffering/rejoining truncated SSE JSON payloads per session (1 MiB cap).
- **Codex/CommandCode Tool-Call Streams** — Stable per-call tool IDs/indices (using upstream `call_id`), correct `[DONE]` framing, and checked `w.Write` errors.
- **MITM Goroutine Leaks** — `Stop()` drains in-flight connections (WaitGroup + active conn close); request bodies bounded at 10 MiB.
- **Executor/OAuth Registry Mutexes** — Package-level registry maps now guarded by `sync.RWMutex` (race-free on re-registration).
- **Token Saver JSON Number Preservation** — `CompressMessages`/`InjectSystemPrompt` use `json.Number` so numeric fields (temperature, large ints) round-trip unchanged.
- **`interface{}` → `any`** — Lint cleanup across stream/log packages.

## [v1.5.0] — 2026-07-24

### 🚀 Architecture & Observability Enhancements

- **Modular `main.go` Refactoring** — Extracted CLI subcommands (`mitmEnable`, `mitmDisable`, `mitmStatus`, `resolveDataDir`) to `cmd/9router-go/commands.go` and encapsulated server routing setup into `handlers.SetupServerRouter()`.
- **Structured Request Logging Middleware** — Moved `statusWriter` and `RequestLogger` to `internal/middleware/logging.go`. Requests are logged with Correlation ID (`id=req_...`) using structured logger (`slog.Info`, `slog.Warn`, `slog.Error`).
- **Dynamic HTTP Status Log Levels** — Requests with status 5xx are logged at `ERROR` level, 4xx at `WARN` level, and 2xx/3xx at `INFO` level for clean log filtering in production.
- **Upstream Memory Exhaustion Protection** — Added `io.LimitReader` caps (1MB for upstream error bodies, 10MB for non-streaming completion bodies) to protect proxy memory from rogue upstreams.
- **Double WriteHeader Prevention** — Added `written bool` guard to `statusWriter` and `cw.IsCommitted()` checks across combo fallback handlers to eliminate `superfluous response.WriteHeader` warnings.
- **Typed Request ID Context Key** — Shared `log.RequestIDKey` across middleware and logging packages to ensure context lookups match reliably.

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-07-23

### 🛠️ Technical Debt Remediations (All 9 Items Resolved)

- **Context-based Per-Request Usage Capture** — Replaced global `translator.lastUsage` with context-captured isolation (`WithUsageCapture`, `SetUsage`, `GetAndClearUsage`) to eliminate cross-request data races under concurrent traffic. (`internal/translator/usage.go`)
- **Thread-safe Daily Usage Updates** — Protected `upsertDailyUsage()` with `dailyUsageMu` mutex to prevent concurrent SQLite read-modify-write races. (`internal/handlers/chat/usage.go`)
- **Committed Response Writer** — Wrapped `http.ResponseWriter` with `committedResponseWriter` to prevent safe-retry attempts after response headers have already been sent to the client. (`internal/handlers/chat/response_writer.go`)
- **Strict Context Propagation** — Replaced all `http.NewRequest` with `http.NewRequestWithContext` across handlers, proxy execution drivers, and OAuth helpers to prevent orphaned upstream connections.
- **Graceful Shutdown** — Implemented `http.Server` graceful shutdown with signal drain (15-second timeout) on SIGINT/SIGTERM. (`cmd/9router-go/main.go`)
- **SQLite Connection Pool Optimization** — Reduced SQLite `SetMaxOpenConns(4)` for optimal WAL mode performance and zero connection contention. (`internal/db/client.go`)
- **Thread-Safe ProxyPool Cache** — Added `sync.Map` `proxyPoolCache` in `internal/db/proxyPools.go` to preserve round-robin rotation indices across requests. (`internal/db/proxyPools.go`)
- **Unbounded Request Body Guard** — Added `middleware.MaxBody` (10MB limit) to protect all endpoints from OOM attacks. (`internal/middleware/max_body.go`, `cmd/9router-go/main.go`)

### ⚡ Metrics, Latency & Token Accounting Fixes

- **TTFT & Latency Tracking** — Added `StartTime` and `TTFT` tracking across all streaming and non-streaming proxy execution drivers (`openai`, `opencode`, `deepseek`, `claude`, `grok-cli`, `qoder`, etc.). (`internal/proxy/executor/`)
- **Input Token Calculation Fix** — Added `[]byte` type support to `CountValueChars` so fallback prompt token calculation accurately estimates token size instead of defaulting to 1 token. (`internal/handlers/chat/chat.go`)
- **Output Token Calculation Fix** — Connected `ResponseBuf` in `executor.Request` to record stream output tokens when upstream omits token usage objects. (`internal/proxy/executor/openai.go`)
- **Prompt Caching Tokens Support** — Updated `OpenAIUsage` to extract `cached_tokens` (`prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) and `cache_creation_input_tokens`. (`internal/translator/types.go`, `internal/handlers/chat/usage.go`)

### 🧪 End-to-End Integration Test Suite

- **E2E Test Suite** — Added `internal/handlers/chat/e2e_integration_test.go` to test real HTTP streaming SSE, non-streaming JSON responses, TTFT latency, token accounting, and SQLite DB usage logging end-to-end.

### 🌐 Endpoints

- **`/api/hello`** — Registered `/api/hello` route returning `200 OK` for ping probes from Claude Code CLI. (`cmd/9router-go/main.go`)

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-07-22

### 🏥 Next.js-Compatible Health System

- **Connection-based health** — Replaced old `kv`-based `IsProviderHealthy`/`RecordProviderHealth` with `modelLock_*` fields in `providerConnections.data` JSON blob, matching Next.js `markAccountUnavailable` / `clearAccountError` flow. (`internal/db/health.go`, `internal/db/accounts.go`)
- **Per-connection model locks** — `LockConnectionModel` / `UnlockConnectionModel` / `IsConnectionModelLocked` use SQLite `json_set()` on shared `providerConnections.data`. Dashboard can read/write same fields. (`internal/db/accounts.go`)
- **`IsProviderAvailable`** — New `Repo` method checks if ANY connection for a provider has no active `modelLock_<model>`, replacing the old kv-based pre-check. (`internal/db/accounts.go`)
- **`POST /admin/health/reset`** — Resets `modelLock_*` on connections via query params `?provider=X&model=X`. Dashboard can call via headroom proxy. (`cmd/9router-go/main.go`)
- **Eliminated duplication** — Package-level `IsProviderHealthy` / `ResetProviderHealth` now delegate to `NewRepo(database)` instead of duplicating lock JSON parsing logic. (`internal/db/health.go`)

### 🧪 Test Fixes

- **False-pass assertions** — 3 handler tests were checking old kv-based `repo.IsModelLocked()` which always returned `false` vacuously. Changed to `repo.IsConnectionModelLocked(connID, model)` to actually verify connection-level locks. (`internal/handlers/chat_test.go`)

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-07-22

### 🎯 Gemini Tool Calling Fixes

- **thought_signature round-trip** — Gemini response encodes `thought_signature` into tool call `id` via `__ts__` separator; request decoder restores it for valid verification. Works for both streaming and non-streaming. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Antigravity (AGY) support** — Custom `GeminiPart.UnmarshalJSON` handles `thoughtSignature` (camelCase) AND `thought_signature` (snake_case) since the internal `v1internal` endpoint returns camelCase. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`)
- **Tool response name fix** — `tool_call_id` with `__ts__` suffix no longer corrupts `functionResponse.name` extraction, preventing Gemini validation errors on turn 2. (`internal/translator/gemini.go`)

### 🎨 Logging

- **ANSI color-coded logs** — `INF` = green, `WRN` = yellow, `ERR` = red, `DBG` = cyan. Auto-detects TTY (disabled when piped). Disable via `NO_COLOR=1`. (`internal/log/log.go`)

### 🔧 Streaming Fixes

- **SSE multi-line** — Gemini stream chunks with multiple SSE lines (`data: ...\ndata: ...`) are now split and translated individually. Error on one line continues to next instead of aborting. (`internal/handlers/gemini_handler.go`)

### 🧹 Cleanup

- `fallback.go`: Removed misleading `WRN tokensaver failed` logs — replaced with idiomatic `if next, did := ...; did` pattern.
- `test_opencode.go`: Removed (stale temporary test file).
- `internal/translator/gemini_test.go`: Added (unit tests for `thought_signature` round-trip).

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-07-21

### 🚀 New Features

- **SSRF protection** — `/v1/web/fetch` now blocks requests to private/internal IPs (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local, cloud metadata). Matches Next.js `assertPublicUrl()`. (`internal/handlerutil/ssrf.go`)
- **Bypass handler** — Detects Claude Code naming, warmup, and count requests. Returns fake responses without calling upstream, preventing wasted combo rotation slots. (`internal/handlers/bypass.go`)
- **Structured logging** — New `internal/log` package with Info/Warn/Error/Debug levels, runtime config via `LOG_LEVEL` env var. All ~100 `log.Printf` calls replaced across 24 files.
- **Per-connection model locks** — Model locks now stored as `modelLock_<model>` in `providerConnections.data` JSON blob. DB-compatible with Next.js dashboard. Connection A and B can have independent lock states.
- **SSE stall detection** — `StallReader` wrapper closes upstream connection after 6 minutes of no data, preventing hung streams. Integrated into all 4 SSE stream paths.
- **Error classification** — Text-based error rules (8 patterns) + status-based rules (5 codes) + exponential backoff (2s–5min). Fully matching Next.js `checkFallbackError()`.
- **Retry-after tracking** — Tracks earliest `retryAfter` across combo models, includes `Retry-After` header in error responses.
- **Request ID tracing** — Every response includes `X-Request-ID` header, access log includes `id=xxx` prefix.
- **Combo strategies aligned with Next.js** — Sticky round-robin, auto-capability-switch (vision/pdf detection).
- **Health/lock check in combo loops** — Skip unhealthy or locked models during fallback iteration.

### 🔧 Refactoring

- **Error response consistency** — `WriteJSONError` now status-code-aware (e.g., 401 → `authentication_error`, 429 → `rate_limit_error`). `auth.go` inline JSON replaced.
- **SSE consolidation** — `proxy.WriteSSEHeaders` shared by all 4 SSE stream functions. `proxy.SSECopy` with optional `onChunk` callback.
- **Shared test fixture** — `internal/dbtest` package provides canonical `CreateTables()` eliminating duplicated schema in 5+ test files.
- **`stringBuilder` → `bytes.Buffer`** — Removed duplicate custom type in favor of standard library.

### 📚 Documentation

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — 10 Mermaid flow diagrams (request lifecycle, combo, fusion, error classification, etc.)
- `DATABASE.md` — All 11 tables, JSON blob structure, Go vs Next.js differences

### 🐛 Fixes

- `RetryAfter` ceiling calculation corrected from floor to proper ceiling (`time.Second - 1`)
- Stream translation now handles `[DONE]` marker before JSON parsing
- `TranslateResp` field now passed in `tryForwardWithConnection`

## [v1.0.2] — Previous

- Initial release with OpenAI/Claude SSE proxy, combo fallback, token savers, benchmark results.
