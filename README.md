[![Release](https://github.com/wicahma/9router-go/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wicahma/9router-go/actions/workflows/release.yml)

9router-go is a single-binary AI gateway and dashboard. The Go process serves the OpenAI-, Claude-, Gemini-, and Ollama-compatible proxy APIs on the same port as a Svelte 5 dashboard. The dashboard is built with Vite, embedded in the binary, and needs no Node.js or separate web server at runtime.

Open `http://localhost:20130` after starting an existing, initialized 9router data directory.

> **Version and compatibility baseline:** the Go release is **v1.9.1** (`VERSION`, `version.json`, and `internal/updater.CurrentVersion`). The local upstream checkout and Go manifest declare [`decolua/9router` v0.5.85](https://github.com/decolua/9router) as the synchronization baseline, while published upstream npm/Docker `latest` is v0.5.86. `CHANGELOG.md` records selected v0.5.86 parity work under Go v1.9.0 and explicitly deferred work; this is not a claim of complete endpoint, provider, or feature parity.

## Features

- Native Svelte 5 dashboard for providers, OAuth connections, provider nodes, combos, proxy pools, API keys, models, usage, quota, and settings
- Live dashboard panels: today's mini-stats in the top bar (input / cached / est. cost / requests), per-provider model labels on the provider topology, a live request card in the sidebar (in-flight provider/model + last completed tokens), and an error-log card listing recent failed requests with status, provider, model, tokens, and attempt count
- OpenAI Chat Completions, Claude Messages, Gemini, Ollama-compatible, Responses, embeddings, media, search, and web-tool paths
- Combos with fallback, round-robin, sticky routing, fusion, capability-aware reordering, and account fallback
- Per-provider executors plus OpenAI-compatible and Gemini-native defaults; OAuth refresh and reactive 401 retry
- Bidirectional request/response translation, streamed SSE handling, usage capture, live usage/console streams, and stall detection
- SQLite WAL persistence, proxy pools, outbound proxy support, token-saver options, self-update, MITM commands, Docker, and cross-compilation

Detailed routing and provider behavior is documented in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Schema details and compatibility notes are in [`DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md).

## Install

### Release binary

Download the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wicahma/9router-go/releases/latest), then verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt` from that release.

Release artifacts:

| Platform | Architecture | Binary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `amd64` | `9router-go-linux-amd64` |
| Linux | `arm64` | `9router-go-linux-arm64` |
| macOS | `amd64` | `9router-go-darwin-amd64` |
| macOS | `arm64` | `9router-go-darwin-arm64` |
| Windows | `amd64` | `9router-go-windows-amd64.exe` |

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:20130/health
```

The bundled compose file persists `/data` in the `9router-data` volume. The image also contains the embedded dashboard; JavaScript is only needed while building the image.

> A new Docker volume is an empty SQLite file, not a complete schema. See [Database compatibility](#database-compatibility-and-bootstrap-limit) before first use.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: Go 1.27 and Bun 1.x. The Go package embeds `web/dist`, so build the dashboard before compiling the binary.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wicahma/9router-go.git
cd 9router-go

make web-build       # bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build
make build           # embeds VERSION into the Go binary
```

Rebuild dashboard assets after frontend changes:

```bash
FORCE=1 make web-build
make build
```

`go build` alone is sufficient only when a current `web/dist/index.html` already exists.

## Run

The server reads `.env` and environment variables. There are no `--port` or `--db-path` flags; use `PORT` and `DB_PATH`.

```bash
PORT=20130 DATA_DIR="$HOME/.9router" ./9router-go
```

Common alternatives:

```bash
# Keep the default database path but move the data directory.
DATA_DIR=/srv/9router PORT=20130 ./9router-go

# Select a SQLite file explicitly.
DB_PATH=/srv/9router/data.sqlite PORT=20130 ./9router-go

# Restrict the listener to a local reverse proxy.
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=20130 ./9router-go

# Check liveness and release metadata.
curl http://localhost:20130/health
./9router-go version
```

The supported global flags are `--rtk`, `--caveman`, `--ponytail`, `--auto-update`, and `--no-injection-guard`. `make run` and `make dev` pass the corresponding Make variables. Commands are also available for `version`, `update`, and `mitm enable|disable|status`.

### Client setup

Use the gateway base URL and an active key created in **Settings → API Keys**:

```bash
curl http://localhost:20130/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key' \
  -d '{"model":"ag/gemini-3.8-flash-high","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

For Claude Messages clients, use `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20130/v1`. Engine routes always require an active client API key; `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-API-Key` are supported. Query-string keys are accepted only on paths ending in `/stream` for browser `EventSource` clients.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `20130` | HTTP port |
| `HOST` / `BIND_ADDR` | all interfaces | Listener address |
| `DATA_DIR` | `~/.9router`; `%APPDATA%/9router` on Windows | Data root |
| `DB_PATH` | `$DATA_DIR/db/data.sqlite` | SQLite file; a directory is resolved when it contains a known database |
| `JWT_SECRET` | generated into `$DATA_DIR/jwt-secret` | Dashboard session signing secret |
| `INITIAL_PASSWORD` | unset; compatibility fallback is `123456` | First dashboard password before a saved hash exists |
| `API_KEY_SECRET` | compatibility default | API-key hashing compatibility setting |
| `MACHINE_ID_SALT` | compatibility default | Machine identity compatibility setting |
| `RTK_ENABLED` | `true` | RTK input compression |
| `CAVEMAN_ENABLED` | `false` | Caveman terse style |
| `PONYTAIL_ENABLED` | `false` | Ponytail code style |
| `AUTO_UPDATE` | `false` | Background self-update |
| `INJECTION_GUARD_DISABLED` | `false` | Disable prompt-injection detection |
| `LOG_FILE` | standard error | Append server logs to a file |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | Log output format: `text` or `json` |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` | Go proxy defaults | Optional upstream egress proxy |
| `FX_LOGGING` | `false` | Emit Fx lifecycle events |
| `PPROF_ENABLED` | `false` | Expose `/debug/pprof/*`; keep disabled on untrusted networks |
| `TRUST_PROXY` / `TRUST_CLOUDFLARE` | unset | Trust forwarded client-IP headers for login limiting |

`.env.example` documents the security-sensitive subset and optional OAuth client overrides.

## Authentication boundaries

- `GET /health`, the dashboard HTML/assets, `/login`, auth status/login/logout, and provider OAuth callback landing pages are public.
- Proxy and compatibility routes are protected by `RequireApiKey`; this is not controlled by the dashboard's `requireLogin` setting.
- Dashboard management APIs use `RequireDashboardAuth`. Access is allowed when dashboard login is disabled, or when the request has a valid 24-hour `auth_token` cookie, the local `x-9r-cli-token`, or an active client API key.
- Destructive/admin operations require a valid dashboard session or local CLI token. Standard client API keys are rejected for shutdown, update, health reset, and database export/import.
- A remote fresh-install login using the compatibility default password is refused until the password is changed or `INITIAL_PASSWORD` is set. Local access still accepts the compatibility password until a dashboard password hash is stored.

## API surface

The most commonly used routes are:

```text
POST /v1/chat/completions       OpenAI Chat Completions
POST /v1/messages               Claude Messages
POST /v1/messages/count_tokens  Claude token counting
POST /v1/responses              Responses API
POST /v1/responses/compact      Compact Responses API
POST /v1/embeddings             Embeddings
POST /api/chat                  Ollama-compatible chat
GET  /v1/models                 Model catalog (?connected=1 = only models behind active connections; ?all=1 = include entries the default view hides)
GET  /v1/models/info            Model capabilities and limits
GET  /v1/models/{kind}          Models filtered by kind

POST /v1/images/generations     Image generation
POST /v1/videos/generations     Video generation
POST /v1/audio/speech           Text to speech
POST /v1/audio/transcriptions   Speech to text
POST /v1/search                 Provider-selected web search
POST /v1/scrape                 Web scrape

GET  /api/usage/stream          Live usage SSE
GET  /api/usage/stats           Current usage statistics
GET  /api/usage/request-details Paged recorded request details (?status= filters rows, e.g. ?status=error)
GET  /translator/console-logs/stream
                               Live console log SSE
GET  /health                    Liveness
GET  /api/version               Version and update metadata
```

The request middleware repeatedly removes leading `/v1/` segments before routing, so `/v1/chat/completions` and `/chat/completions` reach the same canonical handler. Some model and dashboard compatibility aliases are also registered explicitly.

## Database compatibility and bootstrap limit

The Go runtime opens the configured SQLite database in WAL mode with a five-second busy timeout and enforces private file permissions. It reads and writes the upstream 9router table/JSON shapes and adds the Go-only `upstream_leases` table for cross-process Freebuff session coordination.

**Current limitation:** `internal/db.OpenDatabase` creates directories and the SQLite file, but it does not create the upstream schema, seed API keys/settings, import legacy JSON, or run migrations. Only `upstream_leases` is created idempotently. Therefore, a truly fresh DB is not a supported standalone bootstrap path. Start with an existing schema-compatible 9router database; opening an empty file is not equivalent to a successful migration.

The `DB_PATH` resolver recognizes a directory containing `db/data.sqlite`, `data.sqlite`, or `9router.db`, which is useful for common upstream layouts. Back up the database before sharing it between processes or deployments. Provider secrets are stored in the database and files/directories are chmodded private where supported.

## Verify

The CI workflow is the release contract for pushes and pull requests:

```bash
make web-build   # Bun 1.4.2, frozen lockfile
go vet ./...
go test ./... -v
go build -ldflags='-s -w' -o /tmp/9router-go ./cmd/9router-go/
```

For local development of the dashboard:

```bash
cd web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev       # Vite dev server; run the Go server on :20130 separately
bun run lint
```

The web package currently has no frontend unit/component test script. Validate dashboard changes against a running Go server and the affected browser route. `make test-short` runs `go test ./...`; `make vet` runs `go vet ./...`; `make cross` builds release binaries and checksums.

## Operational caveats

- Compatibility with upstream means selected data shapes, routes, and behaviors are ported; it is not a blanket 100% parity guarantee.
- A clean database requires bootstrap by a schema-capable upstream/runtime path; Go currently does not perform that bootstrap.
- The production dashboard is fully embedded, but building it still requires Bun and the committed lockfile.
- The API server defaults to all interfaces. Bind to localhost or protect the port when exposing it outside a trusted machine.
- `PPROF_ENABLED` exposes sensitive profiling endpoints and is disabled by default.
- Release binaries and the self-updater are unsigned. Verify release checksums; Windows may require an explicit allow action.
- Provider availability, account limits, vendor anti-abuse controls, and account-sharing policy remain upstream concerns; client cloaking does not guarantee account safety.

## Roadmap

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for proposals only. Items there are not current behavior.
